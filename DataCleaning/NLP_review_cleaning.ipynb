He got that reputation for the simple reason that it's true. However', 'it's interesting to see how when Sennett knew he had on his hands a comedian whose laughs come from subtleties or reactions rather than fast antics', 'he knows to slacken the pace. That was true with many of the brilliant Harry Langdon shorts he would produce later', 'and it is true here in \"Mickey\" with Mabel Normand.Mabel is the star and it is she on which the movie turns. She steals every scene she appears in and has infinite screen magnetism', 'with her attractive', 'fascinating face', 'constantly changing expression', 'and childlike and uninhibited yet somehow ironic manner. The greatest moments of comedy come in little bits of performance', 'as Mabel comes up with many ingenious ways to hide dust she has swept up', 'or simply can't resist eating cherries off a cake.That said', 'there are not actually a lot of scenes of overt comedy in this film', 'and sometimes when there is overt comedy it comes out as a digression or bit of broad slapstick that is well-executed but has a different feel -- the battle in the country store (which looks a lot like the one Arbuckle worked at in \"The Butcher Boy\") over Mable's dog or the animal the scurries up her pantleg. It's not actually an uproariously funny film', 'but doesn't usually try to be', 'and it's always pleasant.The plot is simple and of a kind that has spawned infinite variations. Mabel is a rough-hewn girl from a miner town who loves playing with animals and skinny dipping (from a very wide angle); she is sent to her rich aunt and becomes involved in a kind of love square through no fault of her own. It's really as much melodrama as anything else', 'but it comes off. There are plenty of twists', 'especially as the end draws near', 'involving who is rich and who is poor when; these remain able to keep the interest', 'and make a kind of commentary too', 'intentional or not', 'on the true insignificance of wealth.This has been cited as the first feature-length comedy starring a single comedian rather than an ensemble cast', 'but even so it feels fairly developed as a form', 'with decent pacing and plot developing in two places at once. This is a simple story well told', 'and really made by its star', 'who is well showcased.', 'Country tomboy Mabel Normand (as Mickey) is sent from rustic Feather River', 'California to live on her snooty aunt's Long Island', 'New York estate. The free-spirited Ms. Normand enjoys cavorting with animals - and skinny-dipping for cameramen with very long lenses. Nobody is sure if Normand owns a gold mine or is penniless', 'so she is treated as both an heir and a servant (at different times). Normand attracts debonair millionaire Wheeler Oakman (as Herbert Thornhill) and overly amorous Lew Cody (as Reggie Drake). After numerous hi-jinks', '\"Mickey\" ends up with a winning man and (we hope) lives happily ever after...That Mabel Normand did not survive the ravages of fame was a great loss...Normand was an excellent actress and comedienne. Unfortunately', 'she did not leave behind enough material to fully appreciate her worth. This production reportedly took two years to complete', 'with Normand's personal problems contributing to the delays. Fortunately', 'her \"partying\" lifestyle does not adversely affect Normand's performance as \"Mickey\". This was one of Normand's best feature-length films. The plot is rather ordinary', 'but the star handles each situation well. Herein', 'she is most memorable portraying a carefree servant girl', 'sliding down the banister and ingeniously sweeping her aunt's dusty mansion floors.******* Mickey (8/11/18) F. Richard Jones ~ Mabel Normand', 'Wheeler Oakman', 'Lew Cody', 'George Nichols', 'The adventures of a gold miner's daughter', 'Mickey stars Mabel Normand', 'who was one of the biggest film stars of the teens and 20s. In a series of episodes that are loosely connected', 'Normand plays a Cinderella-like character who goes to live with a relative (Laura La Varnie) but when it's discovered the gold mine is a bust', 'she is made a maid in the household. But she catches the eye of the old lady's daughter (Minta Durfee) and is eventually sent back to the country just as the mine strikes it big. The suitor (Wheeler Oakman) follows her. The plot seems to stray here and there without much narrative thread. At one point', 'a lecher (Lewis Cody) is chasing Mabel around a mansion', 'and then we're off to the horse races. But while the episodes are tacked together', 'Mabel Normand holds the viewer's attention throughout the 90 minutes.This film was co-produced by Normand and Mack Sennett. George Nichols', 'Minnie Devereaux', 'Tom Kennedy', 'and Edgar Kennedy co-star. And yes Minta Durfee was famous for being the wife of Roscoe \"Fatty\" Arbuckle', 'a famous co-star with Normand in many short films. And the music by Neil Moret (who died in 1943) is absolutely great. I hummed the songs for days and learned to play them on the piano.', 'Normand's reputation is that she was a superbly gifted and beloved comedienne whose career was thwarted by scandal and her own reckless behavior. Having just read Lefler's \"Mabel Normand The Life and Career of a Hollywood Madcap'', 'I was surprised to learn that 'Mickey' - a HUGE box-office success - was in the public domain and available. This film was so popular it was in continual theatrical release for 4 years - an astonishing feat! - when the average film run was 2 weeks.So I watched it. On YouTube. Not the ideal venue', 'of course', 'but even so', 'I fail to see why this film was so popular. Lefler explains the historical context for it's appeal to audiences', 'but still', ''Mickey' seems to me to be rather ordinary. And worse', 'I fail to see that Normand was superbly gifted as a comedienne. The biggest laughs - and there were too few of these - were provided by the dog - a good foil for Normand.Because this film is historically important', 'it deserves to be given a top-tier restoration. Maybe the multi-million dollar Hollywood actors and producers can be cajoled into donating some of their millions for this purpose. Preserving the films of the industry of which they are a part should be to them a cause worthy of their support', 'one that is no less important - and definitely more achievable - than saving the planet.', ''Mickey' jumps quickly from one silly scene to another', 'with the idea of being a comedy', 'but having so few laughs it feels more like drama. When the mean carer at the beginning is nothing but dominant and restrictive towards her it evokes sympathies', 'not laughs. With a complete lack of cleverness in the script then it falls solely on Mabel Normand's lively facial expressions to achieve this', 'but talented as she is', 'it is a bridge too far. Furthermore', 'her bright', 'energetic', 'cutesy performance doesn't sell tomboy to me at all - it doesn't sell to me that she has been raised by this insensitive man for most of her years - and it is either miscasting', 'misdirection', 'poor scripting or a combination of all three.']

theatrical, release, for, 4, years, an, astonishing, feat, when, the, average, film, run, was, 2, weeks, so, i, watched, it, on, youtube, not, the, ideal, venue, of, course, but, even, so, i, fail, to, see, why, this, film, was, so, popular, lefler, explains, the, historical, context, for, it, s, appeal, to, audiences, but, still, mickey, seems, to, me, to, be, rather, ordinary, and, worse, i, fail, to, see, that, normand, was, superbly, gifted, as, a, comedienne, the, biggest, laughs, and, there, were, too, few, of, these, were, provided, by, the, dog, a, good, foil, for, normand, because, this, film, is, historically, important, it, deserves, to, be, given, a, top, tier, restoration, maybe, the, multi, million, dollar, hollywood, actors, and, producers, can, be, cajoled, into, donating, some, of, their, millions, for, this, purpose, preserving, the, films, of, the, industry, of, which, they, are, a, part, should, be, to, them, a, cause, worthy, of, their, support, one, that, is, no, less, important, and, definitely, more, achievable, than, saving, the, planet, mickey, jumps, quickly, from, one, silly, scene, to, another, with, the, idea, of, being, a, comedy, but, having, so, few, laughs, it, feels, more, like, drama, when, the, mean, carer, at, the, beginning, is, nothing, but, dominant, and, restrictive, towards, her, it, evokes, sympathies, not, laughs, with, a, complete, lack, of, cleverness, in, the, script, then, it, falls, solely, on, mabel, normand, s, lively, facial, expressions, to, achieve, this, but, talented, as, she, is, it, is, a, bridge, too, far, furthermore, her, bright, energetic, cutesy, performance, doesn, t, sell, tomboy, to, me, at, all, it, doesn, t, sell, to, me, that, she, has, been, raised, by, this, insensitive, man, for, most, of, her, years, and, it, is, either, miscasting, misdirection, poor, scripting, or, a, combination, of, all, three]

The deliberately artificial and often theatrical settings--flat backdrops', 'fake trees and people in horse costumes included--by Kurt Richter saliently add to the picture's enchantment and fairytale-like narrative. \"The Doll\" is similar in this approach to Maurice Tourneur's 1918 films \"The Blue Bird\" and \"Prunella.\" Like \"The Blue Bird', '\" \"The Doll\" has a few moments that seem reminiscent of the feéries of early-cinema pioneer Georges Méliès', 'such as the Moon's facial expressions and the stop-motion animation to change the doll maker's hair. Highly-artificial theatricality was also adopted for \"The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari\" (1920)', 'although in a very different way. Lubitsch begins the film well by appearing in front of the camera to introduce and arrange the mise-en-scène in miniature--a scene that then fades to the actual set and beginning of the story proper.In it', 'the baron's nephew doesn't want to marry a woman', 'so he purchases what he believes is a life-size doll to be his wife. Meanwhile', 'a real woman', 'the doll maker's daughter', 'is pretending to be that doll to hide that the doll maker's apprentice broke the doll that was based on her appearance. So', 'the nephew thinks he's fooling everyone', 'when he's the one being fooled. It's a simple narrative', 'briskly plotted', 'and very well enacted. The inherent sexism isn't lost on Lubitsch either', 'as a humorous advertisement offers the doll maker's product to widowers and misogynists alike. Additionally', 'there are a few light sex jokes throughout. Ossi Oswalda is wonderful', 'cute and funny', 'with her various expressions and movements', 'including the dancing', 'as she plays the character masquerading as a lifeless doll. Her performance significantly helps make this photoplay entertaining. The slapstick and subplot antics between the wacky-looking doll maker and his young apprentice are even amusing and appreciated.Dancing and a comedy chase make their way into this and other Lubitsch films. The themes of mistaken identity or masquerading as acting and doubles also underlie the humor of several Lubitsch comedies', 'in Germany and America. His three earliest comedies that I've seen (\"The Merry Jail', '\" \"I Don't Want to Be a Man\" and \"The Oyster Princess\") all play with these ideas in different and self-reflexive ways', 'with characters pretending to be someone else. The girl isn't only doubled as a doll; her image is literally doubled photographically during a dream scene. Moreover', 'the theme of fakery extends further in \"The Doll\": the dolls are fake', 'a real woman fakes being one of them', 'which is supported by the fake appearance of much of the film's production design. The entire production coalesces to firmly establish the film's world as fantasy. The sets and designs of Lubitsch's German films seem to have always been impressive', 'but in some of them', 'it feels that they overwhelm their plays', 'or that the narratives and characters were never equal to the grand décors', 'but in \"The Doll', '\" it all fits together.', 'This comedy from the hands of Ernst Lubitsch in 1919 is a joyride through a number of imaginative sets and situations. Even though its artificiality if ever apparent', 'the movie makes it work by playing with the costumes and sets', 'to create a whimsical world where everything can happen.Like other Lubitsch films the plot of this is build upon similar themes such as facade and identity. Although not my favourite of Lubitsch's films it hold a place in the top five. This movie is assured to put a smile on your face the whole way through', 'driven by Lubitsch's at times expressive directing.', '\"Die Puppe\" aka \"The Doll\" ranks with \"The Oyster Princess\" as perhaps Lubitsch's most sublime film made during his German period. Both films are superior in many respects to the well-known but pallid historical drama', '\"Madame duBarry\" aka \"Passion\" (also made in 1919). Lubitsch himself felt that way. In a letter he once submitted to his biographer Herman G. Weinberg', 'Lubitsch considered \"Die Puppe\" and \"Oyster Princess\" as his most outstanding comedies produced in Germany before he departed for Hollywood to make \"Rosita\".An early', 'entrancing example of what Lubitsch would become years later', '\"Die Puppe\" is a supremely funny and delightful silent burlesque', 'filled with the master's light', 'witty', 'and graceful touch. The setting is frothy and artificial and it anticipates Lubitsch's enchanting fairy tale musicals of the sound era.\"Die Puppe\" is introduced by Lubitsch himself with an artificial cardboard. It is a fairy tale about of a young prince named Lancelot(Hermann Thimig) who flees from his uncle Baron von Chanterelle(Max Kronert) to avoid a marriage. He settles in a monastery. There', 'he meets several monks who persuade him to marry a human-like mechanical doll and give them his uncle's dowry. The doll-maker Hilarius (Victor Janson) agrees to Lancelot's interest in his newest doll', 'an exact replica of Hilarius' daughter Ossi (played by Ossi Oswalda herself). But there is a problem: The doll-maker's young apprentice (Gerhard Ritterband) accidentally breaks the arm of the doll and now it is up to Hilarius' daughter Ossi to impersonate the doll in order to cover it up. Lancelot takes the doll/Ossi to his uncle's castle', 'where some of Lubitsch's most inventive gags occur as Lancelot mistakes real Ossi for the doll. He actually falls in love with the doll/Ossi. And the wedding scenes alone are some of the funniest moments ever filmed.If you are a fan of Lubitsch', '\"Die Puppe\" is an essential viewing.', 'All cinema is artificial', 'and there is no getting away from this no matter how much of a realist you try to be. And while authenticity and naturalistic performances are a necessity for drama', 'there are some types of picture in which a deliberate flaunting of artificiality is not only acceptable', 'it is a positive benefit.By this point in his career', 'German comedy director Ernst Lubitsch had developed a unique brand of slapstick', 'the hallmark of which was absurdity and exaggeration. In Lubitsch's world', 'almost anything can happen', 'and often does. The stories he dreamed up with his regular collaborator Hanns Kraly were always whimsical and fairy tale-ish', 'but the Doll is perhaps their most fantastical of all. In it we have a lifelike mechanical doll', 'and a flesh-and-blood woman pretending to be the doll. Rather than go overboard trying to make this look as convincing as possible', 'Lubitsch takes things the other way', 'and stages the whole thing in a phoney and theatrical land', 'complete with wooden sets', 'painted backdrops and pantomime horses. In such a setting', 'the premise of the picture becomes workable.Aside from this', 'the comic stylings of the early Lubitsch farces were becoming increasingly refined. As usual there are lots of jokes based around ridiculous numbers of people doing the same thing in unison', 'or the expressions of characters in reaction. Here Lubitsch shows the confidence to have many of these gags play out in long', 'unbroken takes', 'with hilarious results', 'such as the long shot of Lancelot being chased round the town by a huge gang of women', 'followed by his elderly uncle', 'followed by a servant with the uncle's medication. Often the careful placement of actors means our attention is drawn to the right spot at the right time', 'as oppose to overdoing a gag with a jolting cut. An example of this is the uncle's servant's very funny reaction to Lancelot's suggestion that the uncle get married. Lubitsch has the servant to one side of the screen', 'where it seems natural for him to be', 'but closest to the camera so his face is clear and we instantly notice when his expression begins to change.As the eponymous doll', 'we have here another triumphant performance from Ossi Oswalda. While individual actors were used almost like cogs in Lubitsch's machine', 'there is no denying that Oswalda was surely a great comedienne in her own right. Here she shows impeccable control and timing', 'as she is forced to instantaneously snap in and out of being herself and acting as the doll. She also has a lot of fun pulling faces in this one. Honourable mentions go to Hermann Thimig', 'who is clownish enough to make a lead man in this silly setting', 'and Gerhard Ritterband', 'who despite being a youngster manages to steal every scene he is in. It's a shame these two did not have more distinguished screen careers', 'but of course it's worth bearing in mind that many of these players were more successful on the stage.Speaking of which', 'it's possible that some viewers might be put off by the theatrical artifice of this picture. There is a rather depressingly naïve school of thought among some cineastes that film is film and theatre is theatre', 'and for film to make itself like theatre is to somehow straitjacket itself. But as we have seen', 'Lubitsch's creation of a self-confessed unreal world has given him greater freedom in staging his bizarre humour. Another German director', 'Fritz Lang', 'used a similar approach in his films of the 20s and early 30s albeit for a very different effect', 'whereby he created macabre and stylised art deco cities in which all kinds of comic-book adventures could take place. And in the Doll', 'when we see characters sleepwalking over rooftops or being carried away by a bunch of helium balloons', 'it is reminds me more than anything of the world of cartoons', 'in which the only limitation is the skills and imagination of the animators. With pictures like this', 'Lubitsch was really setting his genius free.', ''The Doll'', 'directed by Ernst Lubitsch', 'is a charming fantasy', 'a splendidly original film inspired by one of the Tales of Hoffmann ... and a movie which also captures the mood of English holiday pantomimes and Hans Christian Andersen. As a bonus', 'this film features an extremely kinky performance (very funny and sexy at the same go) by the delightful actress Ossi Oswalda.In the opening shot we see the great Lubitsch himself', 'setting up a doll's house against a stylised backdrop. A close-up of this model then dissolves into a full-sized version of the same stylised setting', 'from which emerge actors dressed as dolls. From this point onward', 'the entire film is staged on highly stylised sets ... much like 'The Cabinet of Dr Caligari'', 'except that these sets are bright and airy.Old Baron Chanterelle has no family except for his gormless nephew Lancelot. To continue the line', 'the Baron offers his nephew a dowry of 300', '000 francs to get married. But Lancelot is afraid of women. The local prior shows him an advertisement from the dollmaker Hilarius', 'who offers a special service 'for bachelors', 'widowers and misogynists': a life-size clockwork girl! Lancelot decides to marry the mechanical bride', 'collect the dowry', 'then stash the doll in the attic.Hilarius', 'for some reason', 'has made his clockwork doll an exact duplicate of his pretty daughter Ossi (anticipating a similar plot device in the 1949 film 'The Perfect Woman'). The clockwork girl has a control panel on her back (like Julie Newmar in 'My Living Doll') and a crank to wind her up.The real Ossi decides to do some winding up herself: playing a joke on Lancelot', 'she attaches the control panel and the handcrank to her own back and pretends to be the doll. Of course there are problems when the 'doll' sneezes or coughs', 'and eventually Ossi gets hungry and thirsty because nobody offers the doll any refreshments. (How does she handle toilet breaks?)In a frilly outfit with a short skirt', 'Ossi is very pretty as both the mechanical girl and the real one. There is some surprisingly good double-exposure in a couple of camera set-ups when the real Ossi and the mechanical one are onscreen simultaneously. Brilliant camerawork throughout by the great Theodor Sparkuhl.Remarkably', 'Lancelot goes from the wedding banquet to the bridal chamber without ever twigging that his clockwork bride is the genuine article. (We don't see the wedding itself; perhaps Lubitsch feared that audiences would be offended by the idea of a man exchanging wedding vows with an inhuman object ... and in fact', 'an insert shot of a wedding certificate establishes that the wedding was a civil ceremony', 'not a religious one.)The great charm of this film is its mood of fairy-tale unreality. The coachman's horses are played by men in pantomime-horse costumes. A cat and a rooster are played by cut-out figures. The moon has a human face', 'looking rather too much like Oscar Levant! I enjoyed a bizarre scene in which an entire roomful of mechanical girls dance for Lancelot.There's also a remarkable early example of pixilation (stop-action animation using actors rather than mannequins) in a gag sequence in which Hilarius's hair stands on end', 'then turns white.The sequences of Ossi (the real one) dancing stiffly while pretending to be a clockwork girl remind me of the sequence in 'Metropolis' when the female robot takes her first awkward steps. (Could this film have influenced 'Metropolis'?) A comedy sequence in this film prefigures a similar sequence in Buster Keaton's 'Seven Chances'', 'when forty women bent on matrimony pursue Lancelot through the streets.'The Doll' is an absolute delight from beginning to end', 'a film that the entire family will enjoy. I regret only that the German intertitles  were set in a Fraktur typeface which made them very difficult to read. I'll rate this delightful movie 10 out of 10.']|[the, doll, is, a, delightful, feature, the, best, i, ve, seen, of, director, ernst, lubitsch, s, german, films, the, deliberately, artificial, and,

who, is, clownish, enough, to, make, a, lead, man, in, this, silly, setting, and, gerhard, ritterband, who, despite, being, a, youngster, manages, to, steal, every, scene, he, is, in, it, s, a, shame, these, two, did, not, have, more, distinguished, screen, careers, but, of, course, it, s, worth, bearing, in, mind, that, many, of, these, players, were, more, successful, on, the, stage, speaking, of, which, it, s, possible, that, some, viewers, might, be, put, off, by, the, theatrical, artifice, of, this, picture, there, is, a, rather, depressingly, na, ve, school, of, thought, among, some, cineastes, that, film, is, film, and, theatre, is, theatre, and, for, film, to, make, itself, like, theatre, is, to, somehow, straitjacket, itself, but, as, we, have, seen, lubitsch, s, creation, of, a, self, confessed, unreal, world, has, given, him, greater, freedom, in, staging, his, bizarre, humour, another, german, director, fritz, lang, used, a, similar, approach, in, his, films, of, the, 20s, and, early, 30s, albeit, for, a, very, different, effect, whereby, he, created, macabre, and, stylised, art, deco, cities, in, which, all, kinds, of, comic, book, adventures, could, take, place, and, in, the, doll, when, we, see, characters, sleepwalking, over, rooftops, or, being, carried, away, by, a, bunch, of, helium, balloons, it, is, reminds, me, more, than, anything, of, the, world, of, cartoons, in, which, the, only, limitation, is, the, skills, and, imagination, of, the, animators, with, pictures, like, this, lubitsch, was, really, setting, his, genius, free, the, doll, directed, by, ernst, lubitsch, is, a, charming, fantasy, a, splendidly, original, film, inspired, by, one, of, the, tales, of, hoffmann, and, a, movie, which, also, captures, the, mood, of, english, holiday, pantomimes, and, hans, christian, andersen, as, a, bonus, this, film, features, an, extremely, kinky, performance, very, funny, and, sexy, at, the, same, go, by, the, delightful, actress, ossi, oswalda, in, the, opening, shot, we, see, the, great, lubitsch, himself, setting, up, a, doll, s, house, against, a, stylised, backdrop, a, close, up, of, this, model, then, dissolves, into, a, full, sized, version, of, the, same, stylised, setting, from, which, emerge, actors, dressed, as, dolls, from, this, point, onward, the, entire, film, is, staged, on, highly, stylised, sets, much, like, the, cabinet, of, dr, caligari, except, that, these, sets, are, bright, and, airy, old, baron, chanterelle, has, no, family, except, for, his, gormless, nephew, lancelot, to, continue, the,

hilarius, who, offers, a, special, service, for, bachelors, widowers, and, misogynists, a, life, size, clockwork, girl, lancelot, decides, to, marry, the, mechanical, bride, collect, the, dowry, then,

1949, film, the, perfect, woman, the, clockwork, girl, has, a, control, panel, on, her, back, like, julie, newmar, in, my, living, doll, and, a, crank, to, wind, her, up, the, real, ossi, decides, to, do, some, winding, up, herself, playing, a, joke, on, lancelot, she, attaches, the, control, panel, and, the, handcrank, to, her, own, back, and, pretends, to, be, the, doll, of, course, there, are, problems, when, the, doll, sneezes, or, coughs, and, eventually, ossi, gets, hungry, and, thirsty, because, nobody, offers, the, doll, any, refreshments, how, does, she, handle, toilet, breaks, in, a, frilly, outfit, with, a, short, skirt, ossi, is, very, pretty, as, both, the, mechanical, girl, and, the, real, one, there, is, some, surprisingly, good, double, exposure, in, a, couple, of, camera, set, ups, when, the, real, ossi, and, the, mechanical, one, are, onscreen, simultaneously, brilliant, camerawork, throughout, by, the, great, theodor, sparkuhl, remarkably, lancelot, goes, from, the, wedding, banquet, to, the, bridal, chamber, without, ever, twigging, that, his, clockwork, bride, is, the, genuine, article, we, don, t, see, the, wedding, itself, perhaps, lubitsch, feared, that, audiences, would, be, offended, by, the, idea, of, a, man, exchanging, wedding, vows, with, an, inhuman, object, and, in, fact, an, insert, shot, of, a, wedding, certificate, establishes, that, the,

It was particularly influential in Norway', 'the film's location.As The Parson's Widow begins', 'Søfren', 'a divinity student', 'is offered a position in a rural parish¬ provided he marries the parson's elderly widow. He accepts', 'despite his betrothal to Mari', 'whom he passes off as his sister. This theme could exist only in a land where poverty and hunger were facts of life.Modern audiences may find The Parson's Widow overly moralistic and sentimental. It has a 19th century feel owing more to romantics like Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson than to more modern novelists like Knut Hamsun', 'who won the Nobel prize for literature in 1920', 'the year the film was made. At that point', 'national romanticism was on its way out.The story has a few supernatural overtones', 'but this is no horror film. In The Parson's Widow', 'the fantastic elements originate from folk beliefs and function primarily as cultural references.Set in an indefinite past', 'The Parson's Widow makes extensive use of locations at a time when few filmmakers ventured beyond studio doors. It idealizes rural life in a way that anticipates Robert Flaherty's Man of Aran. And', 'like Flaherty's film', 'The Parson's Widow meticulously recreates practices that were rapidly disappearing.The opening scenes were shot at Garmo stavkirke (stave church) in Maihaugen the open air museum in Lillehammer', 'Norway. The farmstead scenes are probably shot at the same place', 'and the older extras would have been the last generation to learn the crafts they demonstrate as part of daily life.People today will view The Parson's Widow primarily because it is an early film of director Carl Theodore Dreyer. But this is no beginner's work. Beautiful composition', 'expressive lighting', 'and obsessive attention to detail are signature marks of the director who gave us The Passion of Joan of Arc and Vampyr. The Parson's Widow stands as a minor masterpiece in its own right', 'but the romanticism is unlikely to resonate with today's audiences.', 'Hildur Carlberg', 'the skilled septuagenarian actress who plays Dame Margarete', 'died in August', '1920', 'two months before this film opened-- a heartbreaking irony', 'in part because the plot involves her youthful husband marrying her only to await her death.The film has marvelous comic moments', 'capitalizing on the fact that medieval European peasants suffered from backbreaking work', 'a total absence of education', 'and a desperate need for dentists. The scene when a couple of clerics (the losers) compete for the job of parson by delivering sermons in which they inadvertently skewer their own backwardness is priceless', 'especially as they are speaking to a congregation of bedraggled and toothless locals who were mostly in church to nap. And the scene where an old lady hocks something out of her nose before returning to her needlepoint-- fabulous.Dreyer', 'a committed naturalist who didn't even approve of make-up on his performers', 'shot this film on location at Maihaugen', 'Norway', 'in an open-air museum of 200 medieval buildings. Even the interiors are authentic. Every frame shows it. Watch particularly for a folk wall hanging in Dame Margarete's home. This is another silent gem from the director of The Passion of Joan of Arc.', 'The Parson's Widow is not entirely a really great silent film; it loses some of its strengths as a satire on marriage and (partially) religion when it starts to get a little sentimental towards the end. But for a while', 'one sees a film by the master Danish filmmaker Carl Th. Dreyer flexing his directorial muscles on something that is something one might not expect from seeing such pieces of perfect tragedy like Joan of Arc or Day of Wrath. Here we get the story of Sofren (Einar Rod)', 'an unconventional would-be Parson who 'auditions' for the position by going on about the devil in an off-beat manner (yes', 'off-beat). He learns that in order to become the village Parson', 'he needs to marry the presumed local old witch', 'Miss Pedersdotter (grim-faced Hildur Carlberg)', 'who lures him in with a piece of cursed cod and has him succumb to marry her - but he really wants Mari (Almroth)', 'and cannot until she dies. But when?There's some splendid comic set-pieces set in here', 'like with Sofren trying to scare the old Miss in a devil-disguised sheet', 'only to be foiled by his own slippers', 'or when Sofren tries to sneak out at night to see Mari and continually gets caught (or', 'in one case', 'another old woman in the bed!) But what's more amazing here is Dreyer's choices in casting. Rod is perfect for this kind of frustrated', 'ambitious but conniving sort', 'with great and imaginative eyes that do a lot while seeming to do little (one compared this as Dreyer doing Day of Wrath as a Chaplin', 'but I don't see much of Chaplin in his main male lead)', 'and Carlberg is so dead-on for this old widow who may or may die (depending on if a life-lengthening potion works) that it's among some of Dreyer's best actors in one of his movies.While Dreyer sometimes loses his footing in the story', 'as mentioned towards the end', 'he makes up for it with some curious scenes', 'like the dance at the wedding', 'or the specific use of colored tints. When Sofron has the weird dream state of seeing a 'young' Miss Pedersdotter', 'we see it in a haze of light red (or maybe blue)', 'and it's completely dazzling for a moment. It might be a slightly lighter affair than his more 'serious' pictures', 'but for the curious digging into Dreyer's catalog', 'it's not at all a disappointment. At its best Parson's Widow has a good', 'hard farcical grip on the subject matter.', 'The name Carl Theodor Dreyer may inspire images of slow pans', 'heavy religious/mystical themes', 'and somnolent pacing', 'but it was not always thus. During his apprenticeship at Nordisk in the early '20's Dreyer scripted', 'edited', 'and directed all kinds of films. \"The Parson's Widow\" anticipates themes in the mature Dreyer', 'namely religion and carnality', 'but cloaks them in an agreeable', 'fast-paced (for Dreyer!) silent comedy.A young parson wins a plum parish in 17th century Norway', 'but is obliged to marry the widow of his deceased predecessor and pretend his attractive young fiancee is his sister. Dreyer milks the situation for gags but goes for a sentimental finish a la Charlot. The master's touch is apparent in the close-ups of the pastor's would-be rivals and parishioners and a slow pan presaging the 360-degree views in \"Vampyr.\" Amazingly', 'HIldur Carlsburg in the title role closely resembles Maurice Schutz', 'the old chatelain in \"Vampyr', '\" and the mother-in-law in \"Day of Wrath.\"All in all', 'a good film. But it is hard to believe that the director of this pleasant work could produce \"La Passion de Jeanne D'Arc\" just 6 years later.', 'I haven't seen Carl Theodor Dreyer's directorial début', '\"The President\" (Præsidenten)', 'yet. I've seen \"Leaves from Satan's Book\" (Blade af Satans Bog)', 'however', 'and it was totally unimpressive. Dreyer took from Griffith's \"Intolerance\"', 'but didn't even manage a simulacrum of the American director's craft. \"The Parson's Widow\" is a much better beginning for Denmark's great filmmaker. It is the work of a director coming into his own', 'even though it's much different in some ways from the rest of his oeuvre.As with \"Leaves from Satan's Book\" and his later films', 'there's the preoccupation with history and religion. But', 'as others agree', 'this is Dreyer light. The story of a man who must marry a hag to become a village's parson', 'and his plots to marry his young fiancée and keep the job despite it is amusing. I thought the devil costume bit was particularly humorous. Dreyer's direction is what makes this worthwhile', 'though. The quick pace', 'not lingering on shots and improved camera positioning compared to \"Leaves from Satan's Book\" make this film more accessible and entertaining.Dreyer again uses masking and fades extensively', 'but this time it adds to the style. He gets the most out of the actors. (It shouldn't be underestimated how quicker shot succession can improve', 'or detract from', 'otherwise unremarkable acting.) Additionally', 'the introduction to the past through the waterfall was an especially nice touch. The confining location sets', 'and more importantly', 'how Dreyer and cinematographer George Schnéevoigt film them also add greatly to this tightly told film. The small church full of dividers is just a great find', 'and they use the spaces of the home of the parson's wife very well', 'with camera placement and continuity editing.']

A title I have heard about for years', 'it is a pleasure to see it in a finely restored format that does justice to its beauty.  The film is made up of four stories', 'a framing sequence and three historical vignettes', 'related by the central theme of a woman trying to defy Death to save her lover.  While the plots are simple', 'the telling is astonishing in vision and execution and each of the four stories has a distinctive', 'entertaining tone -- the brooding expressionistic framing piece', 'a tale of Arabian adventure', 'a Renaissance romance', 'and a comic Chinese fantasy.  I found the Chinese segment especially entertaining and some of the images -- such as the old magician transformed into a cactus -- are incredibly surreal and surprising 80 years after they were filmed. Interesting as the film that made Lang famous and very entertaining in its own right', 'I would recommend this film to anyone who likes cinema of the imagination.', 'Contemporary audiences must have been awed by the spectacle of the three exotic adventure episodes within `Der Mude Tod'', 'but the imagery Fritz Lang employs in the bookends is the most fascinating aspect of the film today. Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton had already occasionally used clever camera tricks', 'but Fritz Lang's film revels in special effects.  Through editing and double exposure', 'he makes it look even now as though ghosts are disappearing through a garden wall', 'or that two lovers' souls are exiting their bodies.  The most exciting thing about Lang's magic', 'of course', 'is that his images act as a foundation for beautiful', 'poetic ideas.  His unusually sympathetic portrayal of Death is just one example of why the outer story resonates so much more than the obvious melodrama in its middle. Lang seems to argue that', 'while love cannot overcome death', 'it retains a power which even death would respect and envy.Rating: 8', 'I don't know why', 'but one of my favorite film genres is German Expressionism. Like American film noir', 'it creates a dark vision of human existence from which a flowering of truth unfolds. And this truth is not what the protagonist wants to hear and comes at a great price.  I love this stuff.I recently had the opportunity to view \"Der Müde Tod\" theatrically', 'and it was pure heaven. Billed as Fritz Lang's first big hit', 'it's easy to see why. Filled with lavish spectacle and special effects', 'the film still maintains it's human level. And such a story: a young newlywed husband is taken by Death on his honeymoon. As in a fairytale', 'the bride is able to confront Death and beg for you her husbands return. Death will grant her this if she can once cheat him of one who is about to die. She is given three chances to pull off this trick', 'which transport her to Persia', 'Venice and China. Death', 'her husband and herself are characters in each of these fanciful locales. All this leads back to a gripping finale in Germany where it all began.As far as silent movies go', 'this is one of the best.', 'Der Mude Tod/Destiny(1921) was the film where Fritz Lang began sharpening his trademarks of emotional and visual motifs.  Focuses on themes Fritz Lang obsessed over in film and life.  For instance', 'the conflict between love and death is faced by many protagonists(male or female) in numerous Fritz Lang pics.  From Destiny(1921) to the director's final film', '1000 Eyes of Dr. Mabuse(1960)', 'Fritz Lang was occupied in his work by philosophies on death', 'life', 'love', 'notion of the after life', 'and redemption.  The visual brilliance of Lang's later Silent films can be traced to this feature.Figure of death is a compelling and sympathetic Lang character whose task is not an easy one.  The character of death in Destiny(1921) does what is required of him without any subjective bias on the people he has to collect. Bernhard Goetzke puts on screen with his performance the most fascinating portrayal of death in a motion picture.  The figure of death in Destiny(1921) is a lonely and sad figure whose wish is to do something else. The title of the film refers to death's inability to move outside of his destiny.Der Mude Tod/Destiny(1921) was influential to directors of the silent and sound eras.  Luis Bunuel was impressed by its amazing visual and sad qualities(thus the film became an influential force in most of Bunuel's work).  It wouldn't be surprising that Destiny(1921) also influenced Ingmar Bergman especially with The Seventh Seal(1957).  Other filmmakers influenced includes Enzo G.Castellari', 'Mario Bava', 'Roger Corman', 'and Terry Gilliam. The film's influences can be looked at in films as Lisa and the Devil(1972)', 'Masque of the Red Death(1964)', 'Keoma(1976)', 'and Brazil(1985).Candleroom sequence is a moment of floating beauty and surreal grace.  The candleroom is an extraordinary visual set with a great deal of imagination put into it.  The Candleroom is symbolic of the place where the Grim reaper watches over to see whose candle(life) will be put out.  An excellent effect involves a candle glow dissolving into a baby.  The Candleroom sequence has some terrific visual effects that blow away the CGI of today's motion pictures.Contains a slateful of extraordinary visuals typical of a German Expressionistic film of that time.  In films such as Destiny(1921)', 'Fritz Lang used an aura of expressionistic imagery to display different emotions from his main characters.  Visual use of the camera reaches its climatic level during the three tales.  An example of why silent films where for the most part a great visual experience compared to many sound pictures. Destiny(1921) matches the astonishing imagery of Die Nibelungen(1924)', 'Metropolis(1927)', 'and Dr. Mabuse Der Spieler(1922) with excellent visuals of its own.Out of Sympathy for a woman whose beloved died', 'the grim reaper gives her a chance to save one of three lives as exchange of return of beloved.  Tale one takes place in Persia with forbidden love affair between Arab woman and Western adventurer.  Tragic tale that benefits from director's imaginary use of Persian locations.  The female protagonist attempts to save the adventurer to no avail.  Least interesting of the three tales and most slow moving.Second tale involves a love triangle with the city of Venice as the story's backdrop.  The woman of this tale is promised to a man of well known prestige who she doesn't love.  Her love is to someone who is not popular and the opposite of her finace.  Includes an ingenious death plot that is similar to a situation in Marquis De Sade story', 'ERNESTINE:A SWEDISH TALE. Her plans ends up in a manner that the woman least hoped for.The Imperial China tale is the third and best of the three tales. Magnificent camera effects gives it a mythical quality that creates a feel for the spectacle.  An astonishing effect and maybe the director's most amazing effect in his silent films involves the creation by a magician of an army of toy sized soldiers.  Deals with the Emperor of China who wants the magician's female assistent who is loved by the male assistent.  Magical feeling of the amazing and bizarre is what makes the third tale something fantastic.\"Love is Stronger than death\" is a good title for a potential documentary of the life and film works of Fritz Lang.  More than any other line in a Fritz Lang film', '\"Love is Stronger than death\" represents a summary of Fritz Lang's filmography.  \"Love is Stronger than death\" deals with Fritz Lang's ideals about metaphysical love that goes beyond the confines of the mortal world.  Destiny(1921) deals with this notion with use of abstract and metaphysical imagery.  \"Love is Stronger than death\" can also be applied to the films of Mario Bava because of his similar fatalistic take on the topic of love.After watching it for the first time', 'I consider Destiny(1921) among the director's finest silent films.  An act of courage is performed by the heroine thus making her a tragic figure.  Acting from the cast shines with moments of expressionistic beauty.  Magificently envisioned by a master of expressionistic filmmaking.  Destiny(1921) shows Fritz Lang's growth as an artist and his capabilites to become a legendary film director.', 'I really was impressed by Fritz Lang's \"Destiny\". It seemed like the pictorialization of a timeless German fable rather than a figment of Lang's imagination. The story of a young woman in medieval times whose beloved fiancée is taken by death while they travel through a small village', 'it is timelessly haunting even now. It must have really hit people hard in 1921 Germany', 'three years after the death and destruction of WWI. The framing story is set around three mini-stories set in ancient Persia', 'Renaissance Venice and China. These stories are well done and diverting', 'but also a bit distracting from the poignant main story which was what I really responded to. Lang seemed totally assured and powerful as a filmmaker even in 1921. Lil Dagover was affecting as the heroine and Bernhard Goetzke gave a powerful and moving performance as Death. He was also great in Joe May's \"The Indian Tomb\" released in 1921 also. I highly recommend \"Destiny\" or \"Der Mude Tod\" to anyone at all interested in silent film or the career of Fritz Lang.']

images, this, early, lang, film, has, recently, been, reissued, on, dvd, under, the, title, destiny, a, title, i, have, heard, about, for, years, it, is, a, pleasure, to, see, it, in, a, finely, restored, format, that, does, justice, to, its, beauty, the, film, is, made, up, of, four, stories, a, framing, sequence, and, three, historical, vignettes, related, by, the, central, theme, of, a, woman, trying, to, defy, death, to, save, her, lover, while, the, plots, are, simple, the, telling, is, astonishing, in, vision, and, execution, and, each, of, the, four, stories, has, a, distinctive, entertaining, tone, the, brooding, expressionistic, framing, piece, a, tale, of, arabian, adventure, a, renaissance, romance, and, a, comic, chinese, fantasy, i, found, the, chinese, segment, especially, entertaining, and, some, of, the, images, such, as, the, old, magician, transformed, into, a, cactus, are, incredibly, surreal, and, surprising, 80, years, after, they, were, filmed, interesting, as, the, film, that, made, lang, famous, and, very, entertaining, in, its, own, right, i, would, recommend, this, film, to, anyone, who, likes, cinema, of, the, imagination, contemporary, audiences, must, have, been, awed, by, the, spectacle, of, the, three, exotic, adventure, episodes, within, der, mude, tod, but, the, imagery, fritz, lang, employs, in, the, bookends, is, the, most, fascinating, aspect, of, the, film, today, charlie, chaplin, and, buster, keaton, had, already, occasionally, used, clever, camera, tricks, but, fritz, lang, s, film, revels, in, special, effects, through, editing, and, double, exposure, he, makes, it, look, even, now, as, though, ghosts, are, disappearing, through, a, garden, wall, or, that, two, lovers, souls, are, exiting, their, bodies, the, most, exciting, thing, about, lang, s, magic, of, course, is, that, his, images, act, as, a, foundation, for, beautiful, poetic, ideas, his, unusually, sympathetic, portrayal, of, death, is, just, one, example, of, why, the, outer, story, resonates, so, much, more, than, the, obvious, melodrama, in, its, middle, lang, seems, to, argue, that, while, love, cannot, overcome, death, it, retains, a, power, which, even, death, would, respect, and, envy, rating, 8, i, don, t, know, why, but, one, of, my, favorite, film, genres, is, german, expressionism, like, american, film, noir, it, creates, a, dark, vision, of, human, existence, from, which, a, flowering, of, truth, unfolds, and, this, truth, is, not, what, the, protagonist, wants, to, hear, and, comes, at, a, great, price, i, love, this, stuff, i, recently, had, the, opportunity, to, view, der, m, de, tod, theatrically, and, it, was, pure, heaven, billed, as, fritz, lang, s, first, big, hit, it, s, easy, to, see, why, filled, with, lavish, spectacle, and, special, effects, the, film, still, maintains, it, s, human, level, and, such, a, story, a, young, newlywed, husband, is, taken, by, death, on, his, honeymoon, as, in, a, fairytale, the, bride, is, able, to, confront, death, and, beg, for, you, her, husbands, return, death, will, grant, her, this, if, she, can, once, cheat, him, of, one, who, is, about, to, die, she, is, given, three, chances, to, pull, off, this, trick, which, transport, her, to, persia, venice, and, china, death, her, husband, and, herself, are, characters, in, each, of, these, fanciful, locales, all, this, leads, back, to, a, gripping, finale, in, germany, where, it, all, began, as, far, as, silent, movies, go, this, is, one, of, the, best, der, mude, tod, destiny, 1921, was, the, film, where, fritz, lang, began, sharpening, his, trademarks, of, emotional, and, visual, motifs, focuses, on, themes, fritz, lang, obsessed, over, in, film, and, life, for, instance, the, conflict, between, love, and, death, is, faced, by, many, protagonists, male, or, female, in, numerous, fritz, lang, pics, from, destiny, 1921, to, the, director, s, final, film, 1000, eyes, of, dr, mabuse, 1960, fritz, lang, was, occupied, in, his, work, by, philosophies, on, death, life, love, notion, of, the, after, life, and, redemption, the, visual, brilliance, of, lang, s, later, silent, films, can, be, traced, to, this, feature, figure, of, death, is, a, compelling, and, sympathetic, lang, character, whose, task, is, not, an, easy, one, the, character, of, death, in, destiny, 1921, does, what, is, required, of, him, without, any, subjective, bias, on, the, people, he, has, to, collect, bernhard, goetzke, puts, on, screen, with, his, performance, the, most, fascinating, portrayal, of, death, in, a, motion, picture, the, figure, of, death, in, destiny, 1921, is, a, lonely, and, sad, figure, whose, wish, is, to, do, something, else, the, title, of, the, film, refers, to, death, s, inability, to, move, outside, of, his, destiny, der, mude, tod, destiny, 1921, was, influential, to, directors, of, the, silent, and, sound, eras, luis, bunuel, was, impressed, by, its, amazing, visual, and, sad, qualities, thus, the, film, became, an, influential, force, in, most, of, bunuel, s, work, it, wouldn, t, be, surprising, that, destiny, 1921, also, influenced, ingmar, bergman, especially, with, the, seventh, seal, 1957, other, filmmakers, influenced, includes, enzo, g, castellari, mario, bava, roger, corman, and, terry, gilliam, the, film, s, influences, can, be, looked, at, in, films, as, lisa, and, the, devil, 1972, masque, of, the, red, death, 1964, keoma, 1976, and, brazil, 1985, candleroom, sequence, is, a, moment, of, floating, beauty, and, surreal, grace, the, candleroom, is, an, extraordinary, visual, set, with, a, great, deal, of, imagination, put, into, it, the, candleroom, is, symbolic, of, the, place, where, the, grim, reaper, watches, over, to, see, whose, candle, life, will, be, put, out, an, excellent, effect, involves, a, candle, glow, dissolving, into, a, baby, the, candleroom, sequence, has, some, terrific, visual, effects, that, blow, away, the, cgi, of, today, s, motion, pictures, contains, a, slateful, of, extraordinary, visuals, typical, of, a, german, expressionistic, film, of, that, time, in, films, such, as, destiny, 1921, fritz, lang, used, an, aura, of, expressionistic, imagery, to, display, different, emotions, from, his, main, characters, visual, use, of, the, camera, reaches, its, climatic, level, during, the, three, tales, an, example, of, why, silent, films, where, for, the, most, part, a, great, visual, experience, compared, to, many, sound, pictures, destiny, 1921, matches, the, astonishing, imagery, of, die, nibelungen, 1924, metropolis, 1927, and, dr, mabuse, der, spieler, 1922, with, excellent, visuals, of, its, own, out, of, sympathy, for, a, woman, whose, beloved, died,

woman, and, western, adventurer, tragic, tale, that, benefits, from, director, s, imaginary, use, of, persian, locations, the, female, protagonist, attempts, to, save, the, adventurer, to, no, avail, least, interesting, of, the, three, tales, and, most, slow, moving, second, tale, involves, a, love, triangle, with, the, city, of, venice, as, the, story, s, backdrop, the, woman, of, this, tale, is, promised, to, a, man, of, well, known, prestige, who, she, doesn, t, love, her, love, is, to, someone, who, is, not, popular, and, the, opposite, of, her, finace, includes, an, ingenious, death, plot, that, is, similar, to, a, situation, in, marquis, de, sade, story, ernestine, a, swedish, tale, her, plans, ends, up, in, a, manner, that, the, woman, least, hoped, for, the, imperial, china, tale, is, the, third, and, best, of, the, three, tales, magnificent, camera, effects, gives, it, a, mythical, quality, that, creates, a, feel, for, the, spectacle, an, astonishing, effect, and, maybe, the, director, s, most, amazing, effect, in, his, silent, films, involves, the, creation, by, a, magician, of, an, army, of, toy, sized, soldiers, deals, with, the, emperor, of, china, who, wants, the, magician, s, female, assistent, who, is, loved, by, the, male, assistent, magical, feeling, of, the, amazing, and, bizarre, is, what, makes, the, third, tale, something, fantastic, love, is, stronger, than, death, is, a, good, title, for, a, potential, documentary, of, the, life, and, film, works, of, fritz, lang, more, than, any, other, line, in, a, fritz, lang, film, love, is, stronger, than, death, represents, a, summary, of, fritz, lang, s, filmography, love, is, stronger, than, death, deals, with, fritz, lang, s, ideals, about, metaphysical, love, that, goes, beyond, the, confines, of, the, mortal, world, destiny, 1921, deals, with, this, notion, with, use, of, abstract, and, metaphysical, imagery, love, is, stronger, than, death, can, also, be, applied, to, the, films, of, mario, bava, because, of, his, similar, fatalistic, take, on, the, topic, of, love, after, watching, it, for, the, first, time, i, consider, destiny, 1921, among, the, director, s, finest, silent, films, an, act, of, courage, is, performed, by, the, heroine, thus, making, her, a, tragic, figure, acting, from, the, cast, shines, with, moments, of, expressionistic, beauty, magificently, envisioned, by, a, master, of, expressionistic, filmmaking, destiny, 1921, shows, fritz, lang, s, growth, as, an, artist, and, his, capabilites, to, become, a, legendary, film, director, i, really, was, impressed, by, fritz, lang, s, destiny, it, seemed, like, the, pictorialization, of, a, timeless, german, fable, rather, than, a, figment, of, lang, s, imagination, the, story, of, a, young, woman, in, medieval, times, whose, beloved, fianc, e, is, taken, by, death, while, they, travel, through, a, small, village, it, is, timelessly, haunting, even, now, it, must, have, really, hit, people, hard, in, 1921, germany, three, years, after, the, death, and, destruction, of, wwi, the, framing, story, is, set, around, three, mini, stories, set, in, ancient, persia, renaissance, venice, and, china, these, stories, are, well, done, and, diverting, but, also, a, bit, distracting, from, the, poignant, main, story, which, was, what, i, really, responded, to, lang, seemed, totally, assured, and, powerful, as, a, filmmaker, even, in, 1921, lil, dagover, was, affecting, as, the, heroine, and, bernhard, goetzke, gave, a, powerful, and, moving, performance, as, death, he, was, also, great, in, joe, may, s,

I have to say I admire the courage Benjamin Christensen showed in making this film which not only must have offended the sensibilities of the time for the obvious reasons but also because it dared to champion reason over superstition as a way of explaining things which we do not fully understand. This film resonates with its message that those who judged others unjust may not have been just themselves.', 'The writer and director Benjamin Christensen discloses a historical view of the witches through the seven parts of this silent movie.In the beginning', 'there is a slide-show alternating intertitles with drawings and paintings to illustrate the explanations of the behavior of pagan cultures and in the Middle Ages regarding their vision of demons and witches.Then there is a dramatization of the situation of the witches in the Middle Ages', 'with the witchcraft and the witch-hunts.Finally Benjamin Christensen compares the behavior of hysteria of the modern women of 1921 with the behavior of the witches in the Middle Ages', 'concluding that they are very similar.\"Häxan\" is incredibly perfect for a for a 1922 movie. Like in a thesis', 'he exposes his point of view based in his study of the theme along the time. The reconstitution of the witches in the Middle Ages is amazing. The last part with the comparison with the hysteric women is funny in 2010', 'but it was the reality in 1921. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): \"Häxan - A Feitiçaria Através dos Tempos\" (\"Häxan - The Witchcraft Through the Time\")Note: On 16 Aug 2018 I saw this film again.', 'The striking visuals would in themselves be sufficient reason to watch \"Häxan\"', 'but in addition it is a thought-provoking feature that combines dark humor', 'some occasional chilling moments', 'and perceptive commentary on human nature. It's an unusual package and an unusual feature', 'and there aren't many films quite like it.Simply on the surface', 'the series of unusual visuals and believable recreations of bygone eras would make for interesting viewing. Benjamin Christensen added a strong dose of the macabre to practically every scene', 'even in some of the smaller details that are only noticeable upon repeat viewings. Some of it is fascinating', 'some of it unsettling', 'all of it interesting.But there is much more to \"Häxan\" than a mere collection of grotesque images and vignettes. Towards the end', 'in particular', 'the commentary becomes quite pointed. It is quite easy for anyone - film-maker', 'writer', 'commentator - to criticize and condemn the beliefs and practices of the Middle Ages or of any other long past era. But it is far more of a challenge to', 'as Christensen has done here', 'point out the sometimes devastating parallels to one's own era. It is always such a comforting fiction to believe that we are so much more enlightened than past generations have been', 'and yet it is rarely if ever true.Christensen aptly illustrates the point that the inability to deal with the odd', 'the eccentric', 'and the unusual in our fellow beings is a perennial failing of humanity. Each generation simply devises its own means of stigmatizing and punishing those who cannot conform. (Nor is our own generation markedly better than was Christensen's.) This feature can certainly be viewed (either in the original silent version', 'or in the 1960s version with some spoken narration) for entertainment value alone. But it is even more pertinent in its observations on human nature. It's an often unsettling movie', 'with some images that might be bit too uncomfortable for some viewers. But for all that', 'it's an unusual and worthwhile viewing experience.', 'And I couldn't be more pleased! I have never seen this film', 'but thought I would try it out', 'as I have always had a fascination with the grotesque', 'mysticism', 'and the occult. Haxan delivers in spades.This 1922 Danish silent film about black magic', 'witches', 'satanism', 'and the persecution of said subjects during the middle-ages', 'which attempts to make a connection between the ancient phenomena and the modern study of hysteria (modern in 1922)', 'has been wonderfully presented by The Criterion Collection in their new dvd. This new Criterion dvd has the original 104 min. version with a newly recorded 5.0 soundtrack orchestrated from archival documentation', 'and the 76 min. version released in 1967', 'which has narration by legendary counter-culture icon William S. Burroughs.Watching the original version', 'I found it full of great imagery and fine silent acting. Emotions and actions are superbly conveyed by the actors', 'and the sets', 'costumes', 'lighting', 'and effects are all wonderfully done. I especially like the interrogation chamber and the Sabbath scenes', 'which display lots of good props and much deviltry with rather convincing special effects and make-up. The movie is structured in seven chapters', 'the first giving a historical account of witchcraft's origins in literature and illustrations. We then are presented with drama plays', 'having to do with the practice of witches', 'and the persecution', 'trying', 'and torturing of said witches. We are also presented with several instances of the devil manifesting and making demands on his minions. In the end', 'Christensen attempts to make a correlation between the acts', 'mannerisms', 'and various disfigurements anciently attributed to witches and their craft', 'and the modern affects of hysteria. This is apparently the most criticized part of the film', 'as mentioned in the commentary', 'and while it certainly is not as strong as the period dramas', 'I think it does a good job of raising valid questions', 'and does work with the film quite well.As for the quality of the transfer... with the exception of element specs throughout', 'and just a few scenes marred by scrapes', 'the print is very clean and clear. I thought it looked great. True', 'the print could have been cleaned up a bit more as far as the specs go', 'but not every film Criterion does will get the star treatment given Akira Kuroswa's \"Seven Samurai\". So long as contrast is good', 'and edges are well defined', 'I'm usually a happy camper', 'and this transfer delivers.The new score was arranged by film music specialist Gillian Anderson who attempted to recreate the music presented at the film's Danish premiere as best as possible by referencing the list of musical cues printed in the theater's weekly program notes. It includes works from Franz Schubert', 'Richard Wagner', 'Max Bruch', 'W.A. Mozart', 'Tchaikovsky', 'Christoph Gluck', 'and Ludwig Van Beethovan', 'as well as others. Anderson  conducted the Czech Film Orchestra in June 2001. The score does an incredible job of accompanying the film', 'sounds wonderful', 'and is is presented in 5.0 Dolby Digital.There is a knock-out commentary here. Narrated by Danish silent film scholar Caspar Tybjerg', 'the commentary centers on the director Benjamin Christensen's life in film', 'the Danish silent film industry', 'origin of the documentary film genre', 'technical aspects of Haxan', 'the cast of Haxan', 'historical aspects of the study of hysteria in psychology circles', 'the origins of the devil as a character in media', 'and of course', 'the phenomena of witchcraft and witch hunting. References are made to Nosferatu', 'Cabinet of Dr. Caligari', 'the German Expressionist movement', 'The Passion of Joan of Arc', 'The Seventh Seal', 'Sigmund Freud... the list goes on and on. While there is an incredible amount of information presented here', 'with bibliographic references even', 'Tybjerg does an excellent job of tying it all together and presenting the relevance of the material to the film. This was a very engaging look at Christensen', 'his film', 'and the sociological atmosphere both during the middle-ages', 'and during the time of Haxan's production.As for the 1967 version narrated by William S. Burroughs', '\"Witchcraft Through The Ages\"... I must say that I have not sat through the whole thing. In fact', 'I just watched the first two segments before finally succumbing to sleep (I have', 'gladly', 'spent a LOT of time with this dvd', 'but have to sleep sometime). My first impression is', 'while Burroughs is always so interestingly droning yet intense in the same breath', 'the jazz score was just plain ridiculous', 'in the presentation of Haxan anyway. The producer composed a jazz score for the film', 'which by itself', 'is some very hip music indeed', 'but it was just terribly out of place in the film. I'm sure the production was aiming to enhance drug trips rather than present the film itself. With Burroughs involvement', 'I don't think I'm too far of base in this. I'll have to give it another go when I've had some sleep', 'so I can watch the whole thing', 'but I doubt I'll be changing my mind. The jazz score is just too out of place', 'and as Christensen has often said', 'dialogue would ruin Haxan', 'as well as several silent films. After witnessing this 1967 version', 'I must agree with the director.For avid students of special effects', 'I would make an evening of it with Haxan', 'as well as Jean Cocteau's \"Beauty and the Beast\"', 'and \"Der Golum\"', 'found on Elite's \"Masterworks of the German Horror Cinema\" dvd set. Much mysticism', 'magic and enchantment abound in these films', 'and state-of-the-art at-the-time special effects to boot.I am extremely happy with this dvd', 'and highly recommend it to anyone who is into the study of classic film or anyone who is interested in the occult', 'whether solely for entertainment or as a study of sociological phenomena.', 'More commonly known as \"Witchcraft Through the Ages\"', 'this is definitely one of the most bizarre', 'visually arresting movies of all time', 'even nearly 80 years later.  It starts out as a rather dry documentary', 'detailing medieval superstitions and folklore while showing ancient woodcarvings of witches and demons in various forms.  Then we move on into the dramatic portion of the film.  In one scene we see witches concocting potions using the body parts of corpses from the gallows.  One witch walks in carrying a bundle of sticks', 'and undoes the bundle revealing a decomposed human hand hidden inside.  Fans of \"The Blair Witch Project\" should take notice', 'especially considering that the Danish title of this film is \"Haxan\"', 'also the name of the movie company that created \"Blair Witch\".Director Benjamin Christensen appears as a leering', 'tongue-wagging Satan', 'with very realistic makeup.  The witches are shown with the Devil and his minions performing various acts of sacrilege and perversion that must have been extremely shocking at the time the movie originally appeared', 'and would be offensive to many people still.  The film was banned for many years because of the depiction of these acts (not to mention the occasional nudity)', 'as well as sacrileges performed by nuns and monks.  There are some stop-motion animation sequences (pre-Harryhousen', 'no less) that are very good', 'especially for the time.  This is a difficult movie to describe.  It really is something that you'd have to see for yourself.The version I am reviewing is actually the re-issue from 1966', 'with a dubbed-over narration by beat novelist/junkie William Burroughs', 'and a modern', 'jazzy score featuring Jean-Luc Ponty.  I enjoyed Burroughs' narration quite a bit', 'but oftimes the music is annoyingly inappropriate. Sometimes it works very well', 'but most of the time I was wishing for a standard orchestral', 'or vitaphone', 'score.  A Klezmer score', 'even', 'would have been very effective.  There are a few different versions available', 'some with subtitles and an orchestral score.  Maybe one of these days they'll come out with a version featuring the Burroughs narration along with a more appropriate orchestral score.  That would be perfect.  As it is', 'this an impressive', 'compulsively watchable film that still goes further than most dare to go', 'even in these much more permissive times.']

superstition, i, have, to, say, i, admire, the, courage, benjamin, christensen, showed, in, making, this, film, which, not, only, must, have, offended, the, sensibilities, of, the, time, for, the, obvious, reasons, but, also, because, it, dared, to, champion, reason, over, superstition, as, a, way, of, explaining, things, which, we, do, not, fully, understand, this, film, resonates, with, its, message, that, those, who, judged, others, unjust, may, not, have, been, just, themselves, the, writer, and, director, benjamin, christensen, discloses, a, historical, view, of, the, witches, through, the, seven, parts, of, this, silent, movie, in, the, beginning, there, is, a, slide, show, alternating, intertitles, with, drawings, and, paintings, to, illustrate, the, explanations, of, the, behavior, of, pagan, cultures, and, in, the, middle, ages, regarding, their, vision, of, demons, and, witches, then, there, is, a, dramatization, of, the, situation, of, the, witches, in, the, middle, ages, with, the, witchcraft, and, the, witch, hunts, finally, benjamin, christensen, compares, the, behavior, of, hysteria, of, the, modern, women, of, 1921, with, the, behavior, of, the, witches, in, the, middle, ages, concluding, that, they, are, very, similar, h, xan, is, incredibly, perfect, for, a, for, a, 1922, movie, like, in, a, thesis, he, exposes, his, point, of, view, based, in, his, study, of, the, theme, along, the, time, the, reconstitution, of, the, witches, in, the, middle, ages, is, amazing, the, last, part, with, the, comparison, with, the, hysteric, women, is, funny, in,

the, macabre, to, practically, every, scene, even, in, some, of, the, smaller, details, that, are, only, noticeable, upon, repeat, viewings, some, of, it, is, fascinating, some, of, it, unsettling, all, of, it, interesting, but, there, is, much, more, to, h, xan, than, a, mere, collection, of, grotesque, images, and, vignettes, towards, the, end, in, particular, the, commentary, becomes, quite, pointed, it, is, quite, easy, for, anyone, film, maker, writer, commentator, to, criticize, and, condemn, the, beliefs, and, practices, of, the, middle, ages, or, of, any, other, long, past, era, but, it, is, far, more, of, a, challenge, to, as, christensen, has, done, here, point, out, the, sometimes, devastating, parallels, to, one, s, own, era, it, is, always, such, a, comforting, fiction, to, believe, that, we, are, so, much, more, enlightened, than, past, generations, have, been, and, yet, it, is, rarely, if, ever, true, christensen, aptly, illustrates, the, point, that, the, inability, to, deal, with, the, odd, the, eccentric, and, the, unusual, in, our, fellow, beings, is, a, perennial, failing, of, humanity, each, generation, simply, devises, its, own, means, of, stigmatizing, and, punishing, those, who, cannot, conform, nor, is, our, own, generation, markedly, better, than, was, christensen, s, this, feature, can, certainly, be, viewed, either, in, the, original, silent, version, or, in, the, 1960s, version, with, some, spoken, narration, for, entertainment, value, alone, but, it, is, even, more, pertinent, in, its, observations, on, human, nature, it, s, an, often, unsettling, movie, with, some, images, that, might, be, bit, too, uncomfortable, for, some, viewers, but, for, all, that, it, s, an, unusual, and, worthwhile, viewing, experience, and, i, couldn, t, be, more, pleased, i, have, never, seen, this, film, but, thought, i, would, try, it, out, as, i, have, always, had, a, fascination, with, the, grotesque, mysticism, and, the, occult, haxan, delivers, in, spades, this, 1922, danish, silent, film, about, black, magic, witches, satanism, and, the, persecution, of, said, subjects, during, the, middle, ages, which, attempts, to, make, a, connection, between, the, ancient, phenomena, and, the, modern, study, of, hysteria, modern, in, 1922, has, been, wonderfully, presented, by, the, criterion, collection, in, their, new, dvd, this, new, criterion, dvd, has, the, original, 104, min, version, with, a, newly, recorded, 5, 0, soundtrack, orchestrated, from, archival, documentation, and, the, 76, min, version, released, in, 1967, which, has, narration, by, legendary, counter, culture, icon, william, s, burroughs, watching, the, original, version, i, found, it, full, of, great, imagery, and, fine, silent, acting, emotions, and, actions, are, superbly, conveyed, by, the, actors, and, the, sets, costumes, lighting, and, effects, are, all, wonderfully, done, i, especially, like, the, interrogation, chamber, and, the, sabbath, scenes, which, display, lots, of, good, props, and, much, deviltry, with, rather, convincing, special, effects, and, make, up, the, movie, is, structured, in, seven, chapters, the, first, giving, a, historical, account, of, witchcraft, s, origins, in, literature, and, illustrations, we, then, are, presented, with, drama, plays, having, to, do, with, the, practice, of, witches, and, the, persecution, trying, and, torturing, of, said, witches, we, are, also, presented, with, several, instances, of, the, devil, manifesting, and, making, demands, on, his, minions, in, the, end, christensen, attempts, to, make, a, correlation, between, the, acts, mannerisms, and, various, disfigurements, anciently, attributed, to, witches, and, their, craft, and, the, modern, affects, of, hysteria, this, is, apparently, the, most, criticized, part, of, the, film, as, mentioned, in, the, commentary, and, while, it, certainly, is, not, as, strong, as, the, period, dramas, i, think, it, does, a, good, job, of, raising, valid, questions, and, does, work, with, the, film, quite, well, as, for, the, quality, of, the, transfer, with, the, exception, of, element, specs, throughout, and, just, a, few, scenes, marred, by, scrapes, the, print, is, very, clean, and, clear, i, thought, it, looked, great, true, the, print, could, have, been, cleaned, up, a, bit, more, as, far, as, the, specs, go, but, not, every, film, criterion, does, will, get, the, star, treatment, given, akira, kuroswa, s, seven, samurai, so, long, as, contrast, is, good, and, edges, are, well, defined, i, m, usually, a, happy, camper, and, this, transfer, delivers, the, new, score, was, arranged, by, film, music, specialist, gillian, anderson, who, attempted, to, recreate, the, music, presented, at, the, film, s, danish, premiere, as, best, as, possible, by, referencing, the, list, of, musical, cues, printed, in, the, theater, s, weekly, program, notes, it, includes, works, from, franz, schubert, richard, wagner, max, bruch, w, a, mozart, tchaikovsky, christoph, gluck, and, ludwig, van, beethovan, as, well, as, others, anderson, conducted, the, czech, film, orchestra, in, june, 2001, the, score, does, an, incredible, job, of, accompanying, the, film, sounds, wonderful, and, is, is, presented, in, 5, 0, dolby, digital, there, is, a, knock, out, commentary, here, narrated, by, danish, silent, film, scholar, caspar, tybjerg, the, commentary, centers, on, the, director, benjamin, christensen, s, life, in, film, the, danish, silent, film, industry, origin, of, the, documentary, film, genre, technical, aspects, of, haxan, the, cast, of, haxan, historical, aspects, of, the, study, of, hysteria, in, psychology, circles, the, origins, of, the, devil, as, a, character, in, media, and, of, course, the, phenomena, of, witchcraft, and, witch, hunting, references, are, made, to, nosferatu, cabinet, of, dr, caligari, the, german, expressionist, movement, the, passion, of, joan, of, arc,

excellent, job, of, tying, it, all, together, and, presenting, the, relevance, of, the, material, to, the, film, this, was, a, very, engaging, look, at, christensen, his, film, and, the, sociological, atmosphere, both, during, the, middle, ages, and, during, the, time, of, haxan, s, production, as, for, the, 1967, version, narrated, by, william, s, burroughs, witchcraft, through, the, ages, i, must, say, that, i, have, not, sat, through, the, whole, thing, in, fact, i, just, watched, the, first, two, segments, before, finally, succumbing, to, sleep, i, have, gladly, spent, a, lot, of, time, with, this, dvd, but, have, to, sleep, sometime, my, first, impression, is, while, burroughs, is, always, so, interestingly, droning, yet, intense, in, the, same, breath, the, jazz, score, was, just, plain, ridiculous, in, the, presentation, of, haxan, anyway, the, producer, composed, a, jazz, score, for, the, film, which, by, itself, is, some, very, hip, music, indeed, but, it, was, just, terribly, out, of, place, in, the, film, i, m, sure, the, production, was, aiming, to, enhance, drug, trips, rather, than, present, the, film, itself, with, burroughs, involvement, i, don, t, think, i, m, too, far, of, base, in, this, i, ll, have, to, give, it, another, go, when, i, ve, had, some, sleep, so, i, can, watch, the, whole, thing, but, i, doubt, i, ll, be, changing, my, mind, the, jazz, score, is, just, too, out, of, place, and, as, christensen, has, often, said, dialogue, would, ruin, haxan, as, well, as, several, silent, films, after, witnessing, this, 1967, version, i, must, agree, with, the, director, for, avid, students, of, special, effects, i, would, make, an, evening, of, it, with, haxan, as, well, as, jean, cocteau, s, beauty, and, the, beast, and, der, golum, found, on, elite, s, masterworks, of, the, german, horror, cinema, dvd, set, much, mysticism, magic, and, enchantment, abound, in, these, films, and, state, of, the, art, at, the, time, special, effects, to, boot, i, am, extremely, happy, with, this, dvd, and, highly, recommend, it, to, anyone, who, is, into, the, study, of, classic, film, or, anyone, who, is, interested, in, the, occult, whether, solely, for, entertainment, or, as, a, study, of, sociological, phenomena, more, commonly, known, as, witchcraft, through, the, ages, this, is, definitely, one, of, the, most, bizarre, visually, arresting, movies, of, all, time, even, nearly, 80, years, later, it, starts, out, as, a, rather, dry, documentary, detailing, medieval, superstitions, and, folklore, while, showing, ancient, woodcarvings, of, witches, and, demons, in, various, forms, then, we, move, on, into, the, dramatic, portion, of, the, film, in, one, scene, we, see, witches, concocting, potions, using, the, body, parts, of, corpses, from, the, gallows, one, witch, walks, in, carrying, a, bundle, of, sticks, and, undoes, the, bundle, revealing, a, decomposed, human, hand, hidden, inside, fans, of, the,

director, benjamin, christensen, appears, as, a, leering, tongue, wagging, satan, with, very, realistic, makeup, the, witches, are, shown, with, the, devil, and, his, minions, performing, various, acts, of, sacrilege, and, perversion, that, must, have, been, extremely, shocking, at, the, time, the, movie, originally, appeared, and, would, be, offensive, to, many, people, still, the, film, was, banned, for, many, years, because, of, the, depiction, of, these, acts, not, to, mention, the, occasional, nudity, as, well, as, sacrileges, performed, by, nuns, and, monks, there, are, some, stop, motion, animation, sequences, pre, harryhousen, no, less, that, are, very, good, especially, for, the, time, this, is, a, difficult, movie, to, describe, it, really, is, something, that, you, d, have, to, see, for, yourself, the, version, i, am, reviewing, is, actually, the, re, issue, from, 1966, with, a, dubbed, over, narration, by, beat, novelist, junkie, william, burroughs, and, a, modern, jazzy, score, featuring, jean, luc, ponty, i, enjoyed, burroughs, narration, quite, a, bit, but, oftimes, the, music, is, annoyingly, inappropriate, sometimes, it, works, very, well, but, most, of, the, time, i, was, wishing, for, a, standard, orchestral, or, vitaphone, score, a, klezmer, score, even, would, have, been, very, effective, there, are, a, few, different, versions, available, some, with, subtitles, and, an, orchestral, score, maybe, one, of, these, days, they, ll, come, out, with, a, version, featuring, the, burroughs, narration, along, with, a, more, appropriate, orchestral,

Mood', 'feelings', 'tones', 'and dreams could explain such an irrational world Europe had experienced during The Great War more than any rational thought', 'adherents to those movements felt. Two French impressionist films produced in 1923 related to the Paris art scene created a long-lasting impact in cinema.It's a rarity movie critics have such an influence on the future of cinema while applying their theories to actual motion picture making. Polish-born/French resident Jean Epstein was part of that rare breed of observers and innovators in film. The writer composed several highly-influential articles focused primarily on the visual forms in cinema. Epstein expanded the idea of 'photogenie', '' a term used as early as 1874 to define photography that contained more art than just simple portraits or landscapes. By inserting an aesthetic priority into movies', 'Epstein articulated the separation between the auteur and the more straight-forward fillmmakers' in the metteurs-en-scene camp.Epstein knew the practice of filming stage plays in their entirety and presenting them on the big screen was not taking advantage of what cinema had to offer. He frowned upon the heavily-laden', 'overly-complex plots the film industry was producing; he favored the more visual', 'simple narratives. Camera placements where movement takes place', 'especially positioned in areas such as he did on a merry-go-round', 'plays a part in photogenie. He especially emphasized the close-up as an integral element in his philosophy. He claimed there is none greater movement than framing a close-up of the movie's characters where faces can express their inner emotions and souls. No finer example of Epstein's point is the finale of Segio Leone's 1966 'The Good', 'the Bad and the Ugly', '' where the three combatants in a circle are seen in extreme closeups before shooting.Epstein's numerous articles were eagerly read by filmmakers home and abroad. 'The Senses', '' 'Magnification', '' 'On Certain Characteristics of Photogenie' among others helped define the uniqueness of cinema and its artistic merits. He was especially impressed by Abel Gance's 1922 'La Roue' with its rhythmic montage of quick cuts following the opening train crash. Epstein's explanation on the varying short edits anticipated Soviet Union's Sergei Eisenstein's work on montage editing.Epstein was unusual in that he possessed the ability to not only express deep intellectual treatises on cinema's uniqueness', 'but was able to display his theories on screen. His November 1923's \"The Faithful Heart\"-\"Coeur fidele\" in French-illustrates the critic's written statements on film. He claimed he and his sister drew up its simple plot in one night. Their narrative served the purposes Epstein had in mind', 'where \"a melodrama so stripped of all the conventions ordinarily attached to the genre', 'so sober', 'so simple', 'that it might approach the nobility and excellence of tragedy.\"']

Even though the majority of his work has been lost forever', 'some titles have survived: Herr Arnes Pengar (1919)', 'Sangen Om Dem Eldröda Blomman (1919)', '\"Erotikon\" (1920) and \"Gunnar Hedes Saga\" (1923). These famous films are enough to confirm that Mauritz Stiller has been and are one of the best directors of the seventh art through its long history. He has been able to elevate the \"silent art\" to that great level that we can still now enjoy and appreciate.One important turn in his work was his last movie made in Sweden: \"Gösta Berlings Saga\". This film had disastrous consequences for his career', 'as this Germanic count will narrate later on.Stiller', 'together with Victor Sjöström', 'were the \"father founders\" of the Swedish cinema. Together with Sjöström', 'he is the most famous film director of the 20's. This notoriety was not only in his country because his film \"Sangen On Den Eldröda Blomman\"(1918) made him world famous', 'a status confirmed definitively with that masterpiece \"Herr Arnes Pengar\" (1919).It is very difficult to write about Stiller', 'even in Germanic', 'because it is not easy to find all the adjectives to define his great career; his work had the beauty of a great stylist able to make master pieces in such different genres as \"saga\" (those great stories of the Swedish literature) or that most sophisticated comedy (\"Erotikon\" (1920) ). He was a director who had a big influence', 'even on German directors as Herr Lubitsch who was then defining his unmistakable \"touch\".The legend of Gösta Berling is related to the \"epic\" part of his work. There are big stories replete with character with different backgrounds in several situations that the Nordic director manages very well.The film is an adaptation of a book written by the famous Swedish author Selma Lagerloff', 'who by the way', 'had many disagreements with Stiller's adaptation (ah.', 'the eternal \"auteur\" ego problems', 'almost as classic among the aristocrats'!). Changes were made due to Stiller's lack of respect for the text', 'who changed it according to the necessity of the film', 'more specifically', 'according to the \"visual needs\" of it. As this Germanic count mentioned before', 'Stiller is a great stylist', 'always looking for visual beauty (although it is important to mention that he does not look for hollow images or simple postcards). His interest is very different. In a way', 'he is delighted on the aesthetics of certain scenarios to show us the most miserable side', 'the squalor of the whole surroundings.In spite of those stylistics disagreements between author and director', 'this Teutonic count asserts that the cinematographic adaptation is excellent. Keeping in mind the fact that it is a very dense and complicated novel', 'filled with characters.The Leyend of Gösta Berling tells us the story of Gösta', 'a drunkard minister who is expelled from the priesthood for his \"habit\" (weird Nordic tradition', 'those expellings). But the bigger problem with his parish is his truthfulness. Jobless', 'Gösta finishes in Värmland', 'a state managed by the people of Ekeby.Gösta's strong personality and his special charm with women will bring him many problems. Two powerful families full of hypocrisy', 'lies and adultery; rule two estates in Värmland and they will surround Gösta with plenty of intrigue', 'confusing him and costing him a lot of problems to which he was a stranger to begin with.Only at the end of the movie', 'will our hero will get his redemption from the hand of Elisabeth', 'performed by the fascinating Greta Garbo.It has to be mentioned that for many long-haired', 'Stiller is still \"only\" known as the finder and creator of the divine Greta Garbo; which it is true because thanks to Stiller', 'Ms Garbo got her first great film performance due to her appearance in this movie. This is a great injustice because reduces Stiller's creations to a second place.It is compulsory to praise all the actor's great interpretations in this movie. They were really memorable', 'not forced at all if we take into consideration that around that time it was something very difficult to obtain with certain adaptations or argumentative plots that tended to excesses. It is a movie where also big natural spaces predominate', 'another of recurrent theme of Stiller. This movie combines the beauty of the frozen landscapes with the danger in them.As this Germanic count said before', 'the success that \"The legend of Gösta Berling\" brought to Stiller and Ms Garbo had a different repercussion in their future careers: for her', 'the beginning of a mythic career', 'a cinematographic icon that prevails and still impresses us. For him', 'the beginning of the end as a director when he started a new phase in the United States that lasted for four unhappy years.Watching the formal and stylist beauty of \"The legend of Gösta Berling\"', 'one realises', 'even the oblivious Germanic aristocracy', 'the great loss for the cinema that occurred with Stiller's premature death. He was a fundamental director for both the Nordic and global cinema. His great work has been timeless.And now', 'if you allow me', 'I have to leave you momentarily because this Germanic count has an appointment with a Swedish sweetie.Herr Graf Ferdinand Von Galitzien http://ferdinandvongalitzien.blogspot.com/', 'Gösta Berling is a young and attractive minister. Because he is an alcoholic and his preaches are far too daring', 'he is finally defrocked. He leaves the town in disgrace and arrives at countess Marta's manor.

The new release includes English subtitles', 'the new music score by Matti Bye', 'and restoration of the film to a length of 185 minutes. While it is somewhat imposing in length', 'it really is the only way to see it.Garbo is a larger than life figure. She has achieved immortality', 'due in part to roles like this. Though not everyone can name a movie she is in', 'almost everyone has heard of her. That in itself is quite a feat', 'considering the great actors of the time who are now forgotten except by the biggest movie nerds.', 'I have to change my previous review as I have watched the true version with a pretty darn good soundtrack that Kino released onto DVD and about time too. All I can say is that if you have seen the atrocious VHS version then do yourself a big favour and buy this one', 'there is simply no comparison', 'if you haven't seen the VHS version', 'well', 'do yourself a favour and get the DVD anyway. Garbo is very young in this and quite unrecognisable', 'but', 'she is very good as Elisabeth. You can see why Lars Hanson was later hand picked by Lillian Gish to star with her in \"The Scarlet Letter\" and \"The Wind\" and hopefully this will increase his fanbase. And you're left wondering why director Mauritz Stiller never became the success that another Swedish director Victor Sjostrom was.', 'Greta Gustafsson grew up in an environment that offered scant hope for a little girl who loved to act. Youngest of three children', 'Greta remembers living in a small Stockholm', 'Sweden apartment where in the evenings after work \"my father would be sitting in a corner', 'scribbling figures on a newspaper. On the other side of the room', 'my mother is repairing ragged old clothes', 'sighing.\" She claimed there was always tension in the air', 'making life for the sensitive girl not very pleasant.Later', 'as an 18-year-older', 'her acting ambitions were slowly realized. Greta was able to get her foot in the door primarily because she possessed a pretty face. Gustafsson appeared in several print advertisements before she popped up in a brief filmed scene while attending the Royal Dramatic Training Academy in Stockholm from 1922 to 1924. Director Mauritz Stiller', 'famous for his cutting-edge 1919 'Sir Arne's Treasure' and 1920 'Erotikon', '' spotted Greta and signed her to play a part in his March 1924 \"The Saga of Gosta Berling.\"It was this movie that Louis B. Mayer', 'who had just merged his production studio with Metro and Goldwyn's Pictures to create MGM Studios', 'was in Germany looking for new talent. Swedish director Victor Sjostrom', 'recently hired by Mayer', 'recommended he see the work of his friend Stiller. There's differing accounts on what happened when the film producer saw \"The Saga of Gosta Berling', '\" but Myer's daughter recounts him saying upon seeing Gustafsson', '\"This director is wonderful', 'but what we really ought to look at is the girl ... The girl', 'look at the girl! It's her eyes. I can make her a star.\"Gustafsson eventually went to Hollywood', 'where she was given a new name. Studio executives kept the Greta', 'but her last name became Garbo. The Swedish actress would become the fifth greatest actress in cinema', 'according to the American Film Institute. Not bad for a girl who never attended high school', 'which was par for the course for working class Swedish school girls', 'something that for the rest of her life Garbo claimed gave her an inferiority complex.\"The Saga of Goat Berling\" has been tabbed the Swedish version of America's epic \"Gone With The Wind\" for the breath and scope of its plot. Gleaned from Selma Lagerlof's 1891 novel', 'the movie's about a Lutheran minister who's fired by church elders for his drinking habits as well as for his controversial sermons. Gosta Berling receives a job offer to become a tutor to a countess' daughter', 'Ebba. The countess hopes her new tutor will marry his pupil before her son', 'Henrik', 'whom she despises', 'gets the countess' inheritance.

Most of \"The Saga of Gosta Berling\" production was without her. But her first appearance', '40 minutes into the three-hour plus film', 'and a reappearance in the last 15 minutes', 'changed forever the girl who grew up in relative poverty in a Stockholm slum.\"The Saga of Gosta Berling\" pretty much marked the end of 'The Golden Age of Swedish Silent Cinema.\" With highly-regarded Sjostrom already in Hollywood and Stiller with Greta and actor Lars Hanson', 'who played Berling', 'soon departing for California', 'the leaders of Sweden's film industry were gone. With the exception of Garbo', 'the rest of Sweden's superstar directors had only a modest success in the states', 'unlike in their native country.', 'Decent but overlong (3+ hours)', 'overblown (*cries*) and over-the-top melodrama even compared to most silent drama; I've never been a huge Garbo fan (she had zero subtlety', 'which suits a silent actor) and she is right at home here considering everyone else is just as GRAHND *throws arms out*. There's drunk preachers', 'big speeches', 'fires', 'redemption', 'death', 'love', 'everything you would expect from these types of film', 'in overabundance.

When comparing it to his films at Mutual or before', 'it's evident how far Chaplin had come with his First National pictures: he took his time elaborating and extending fewer gags and set pieces and in developing the plot and characters. His First National films may not always be as continually uproarious as his Mutual ones', 'but they are', 'I think', 'more satisfying and affecting.\"The Kid\"', 'deservedly his most beloved First National release', 'greatly strained Chaplin's relationship with the distributors. He would leave yet another company to continue in his evermore-ambitious efforts. Jeffrey Vance', 'in \"Chaplin: Genius of the Cinema\"', 'makes an interesting observation: he points out that Chaplin plays an escaped prisoner in both his last Mutual film', '\"The Adventurer\"', 'and in this film', 'his last First National release. They both reflect the filmmaker's escape from confining contracts.There's some light satire on a religious community and parody of Westerns', 'and Chaplin gets plenty of mileage out of the common mistaken identity device. I didn't find any of the gags particularly memorable', 'but the hilarity is sustained throughout the film. \"The Pilgrim\" is', 'as religion can be', 'uplifting.', 'I've only seen this as the 40 minute reissue with Matt Monroe warbling Chaplin's song 'Bound for Texas' all the way through it. There's nothing at all wrong with the tune or the singing', 'except that it comes on too often and makes you realise just how ordinary the rest of the score is. Maybe the DVD's better - maybe!The film itself is a pleasure', 'not a joy', 'but it does have some typically wonderful Chaplin moments in it: The jig with the collection-boxes', 'the cake/hat', 'the sticking on his chin of the little 'beard' to make him look tough (what an expression he put on as well!) The reissue moves swiftly along', 'and you're borne with it until you sadly realise that it's over - too fast. Personally', 'the storyline is too thin and the gags though numerous are just too disparate and inconsequential to put this amongst his very best', 'but on a good second level. Charlie's maturer and lesser efforts like this are still towering achievements in comparison with most of his contemporaries and successors best.', 'The Pilgrim is an outstanding example of Charlie Chaplin at work.  So much of what Chaplin did was based on his physical ability to move like a dancer', 'and this film shows off his agility to the maximum.  Charlie tumbles and jumps', 'turns on a dime', 'and makes every graceful movement funny.  The plot is your basic silent movie plot', 'with a lot of mistaken identities and a love interest that leads to a plot climax and a happy ending for Charlie--but without the girl.  (Charlie almost never got the girl at the end of his films.  It was one of his enduring charms.)  The difference between this and a typical silent film is the charisma of Charlie Chaplin. There is simply nothing else like it in film history.', 'Over-shadowed by such classics as THE GOLD RUSH or CITY-LIGHTS', 'THE PILGRIM is a delight and is perhaps Charlie's finest 'short'. Dropping his 'Little Tramp' character', 'Chaplin is now an escaped convict', 'heading out West disguised as a clergyman and who is mistaken for the new Pastor of a small Western town.Sentiment is kept at a minimum and THE PILGRIM is filled with inventive sight gags and sequences', 'with perhaps the stand-out being the middle-section', 'where Charlie suffers from the attentions of a little boy (the bowler hat covered with custard and served as afternoon tea is a wonderfully surreal touch)..The 1959 re-issued version is perhaps the version to see', 'as it comes with a wonderful score by Chaplin and a specially written theme song', ''Bound For Texas' sung by Britain's own Matt Monroe. It's a memorably jaunty song which you will be humming for days afterwards.', 'Having escaped from prison for a crime that is never mentioned', 'The Tramp disguises himself as a pastor as he heads for Texas. Arriving from train', 'he is quickly mistaken as the new curator / priest that the small town is expecting. The Tramp is once again placed into a situation that he was act his way out of. Finding himself in the middle of a sermon', 'The Tramp must perform is way off stage to convince the town that he a priest. The ending', 'although meant to be funny', 'is more political that humor. The 1920's outlook on Mexico was the same as it was since the end of the Mexican American War in the 1840's. The audience laughs as we see Mexico and its people as savage and unpredictable as ever. Although the Tramp survives to fight another day', 'he manages to throw a political message out to the audience before the end of the movie.']

but, it, expanded, to, a, four, reel, feature, when, comparing, it, to, his, films, at, mutual, or, before, it, s, evident, how, far, chaplin, had, come, with, his, first, national, pictures, he, took, his, time, elaborating, and, extending, fewer, gags, and, set, pieces, and, in, developing, the, plot, and, characters, his, first, national, films, may, not, always, be, as, continually, uproarious, as, his, mutual, ones, but, they, are, i, think, more, satisfying, and, affecting, the, kid, deservedly, his, most, beloved, first, national, release, greatly, strained, chaplin, s, relationship, with, the, distributors, he, would, leave, yet, another, company, to, continue, in, his, evermore, ambitious, efforts, jeffrey, vance, in, chaplin, genius, of, the, cinema, makes, an, interesting, observation, he, points, out, that, chaplin, plays, an, escaped, prisoner, in, both, his, last, mutual, film, the, adventurer, and, in, this, film, his, last, first, national, release, they, both, reflect, the, filmmaker, s, escape, from, confining, contracts, there, s, some, light, satire, on, a, religious, community, and, parody, of, westerns, and, chaplin, gets, plenty, of, mileage, out, of, the, common, mistaken, identity, device, i, didn, t, find, any, of, the, gags, particularly, memorable, but, the, hilarity, is, sustained, throughout, the, film, the, pilgrim, is, as, religion, can, be, uplifting, i, ve, only, seen, this, as, the, 40, minute, reissue, with, matt, monroe, warbling, chaplin, s, song, bound, for, texas, all, the, way, through, it, there, s, nothing, at, all, wrong, with, the, tune, or, the, singing, except, that, it, comes, on, too, often, and, makes, you, realise, just, how, ordinary, the, rest, of, the, score, is, maybe, the, dvd, s, better, maybe, the, film, itself, is, a, pleasure, not, a, joy, but, it, does, have, some, typically, wonderful, chaplin, moments, in, it, the, jig, with, the, collection, boxes, the, cake, hat, the, sticking, on, his, chin, of, the, little, beard, to, make, him, look, tough, what, an, expression, he, put, on, as, well, the, reissue, moves, swiftly, along, and, you, re, borne, with, it, until, you, sadly, realise, that, it, s, over, too, fast, personally, the, storyline, is, too, thin, and, the, gags, though, numerous, are, just, too, disparate, and, inconsequential, to, put, this, amongst, his, very, best, but, on, a, good, second, level, charlie, s, maturer, and, lesser, efforts, like, this, are, still, towering, achievements, in, comparison, with, most, of, his, contemporaries, and, successors, best, the, pilgrim, is, an, outstanding, example, of, charlie, chaplin, at, work, so, much, of, what, chaplin, did, was, based, on, his, physical, ability, to, move, like, a, dancer, and, this, film, shows, off, his, agility, to, the, maximum, charlie, tumbles, and, jumps, turns, on, a, dime, and, makes, every, graceful, movement, funny, the, plot, is, your, basic, silent, movie, plot, with, a, lot, of, mistaken, identities, and, a, love, interest, that, leads, to, a, plot, climax, and, a, happy, ending, for, charlie, but, without, the, girl, charlie, almost, never, got, the, girl, at, the, end, of, his, films, it, was, one, of, his, enduring, charms, the, difference, between, this, and, a, typical, silent, film, is, the, charisma, of, charlie, chaplin, there, is, simply, nothing, else, like, it, in, film, history, over, shadowed, by, such, classics, as, the, gold, rush, or, city, lights, the, pilgrim, is, a, delight, and, is, perhaps, charlie, s, finest, short, dropping, his, little, tramp, character, chaplin, is, now, an, escaped, convict, heading, out, west, disguised, as, a, clergyman, and, who, is, mistaken, for, the, new, pastor, of, a, small, western, town, sentiment, is, kept, at, a, minimum, and, the, pilgrim, is, filled, with, inventive, sight, gags, and, sequences, with, perhaps, the, stand, out, being, the, middle, section, where, charlie, suffers, from, the, attentions, of, a, little, boy, the, bowler, hat, covered, with, custard, and, served, as, afternoon, tea, is, a, wonderfully, surreal, touch, the, 1959, re, issued, version, is, perhaps, the, version, to, see, as, it, comes, with, a, wonderful, score, by, chaplin, and, a, specially, written, theme, song, bound, for, texas, sung, by, britain, s, own, matt, monroe, it, s, a, memorably, jaunty, song, which, you, will, be, humming, for, days, afterwards, having, escaped, from, prison, for, a, crime, that, is, never, mentioned, the, tramp, disguises, himself, as, a, pastor, as, he, heads, for, texas, arriving, from, train, he, is, quickly, mistaken, as, the, new, curator, priest, that, the, small, town, is, expecting, the, tramp, is, once, again, placed, into, a, situation, that, he, was, act, his, way, out, of, finding, himself, in, the, middle, of, a, sermon, the, tramp, must, perform, is, way, off, stage, to, convince, the, town, that, he, a, priest, the, ending, although, meant, to, be, funny, is, more, political, that, humor, the, 1920, s, outlook, on, mexico, was, the, same, as, it, was, since, the, end, of, the, mexican, american, war, in, the, 1840, s, the, audience, laughs, as, we, see, mexico, and, its, people, as, savage, and, unpredictable, as, ever, although, the, tramp, survives, to, fight, another, day, he, manages, to, throw, a,

It shows Buster trying to romance the girl away from Wallace Beery', 'and what would have transpired if the story had taken place in (1) the Stone Age; (2) The Roman Age', 'and (3) The Modern Age.I liked them in that order', 'too', 'with more laughs with the older periods of time', 'although I laughed at the hardest at a couple of segments in the Roman Age. My favorite was the chariot race held in the sand. That had a number of clever things in the segment. The brief bit with the lion was funny', 'too', 'sort of a parody of the Biblical story of Daniel in the lion's den.They were smart only going five minutes or so with each age and then going back with the story each time. Each \"age\" had four or five segments in total.Nothing hilarious but definitely worth your time if you are checking out silent film comedies', 'Buster presents love stories from three periods in history - the Stone Age', 'the Roman Age', 'and the Modern Age. In each', 'he vies for the affection of a young woman with another man', 'thus illustrating that emotions like love and jealousy have been constant for time immemorial', 'a contrast to what D. W. Griffith was trying to highlight in Intolerance', 'which Buster was parodying.While the three stories are interleaved together', 'it's notable that at a 63 minute runtime', 'this is essentially three two-reel shorts put together. As Keaton put it', '\"Cut the film apart and then splice up the three periods', 'each one separately', 'and you will have three complete two-reel films.\"The Stone Age story has lots of gags that The Flintstones would later borrow', 'such as prehistoric golfing', 'taking dictation by chiseling into a stone', 'and presenting a business card comprised of a small slab of rock with a crude likeness drawn on it. Buster standing atop a dinosaur', 'despite the bad science and primitive stop-motion effects', 'made me smile. The best moment', 'however', 'was when he tries to arouse jealousy in his beloved by attempting to grab another woman by the hair and take charge of her', 'only to find she's at least a foot taller than him. She knocks him off the rock and we get that marvelous shot of him look up into the camera on the way down to a pond below', 'kissing his fingers before spreading his arms wide.The Roman Age story has a lot of the same types of visual gags', 'like a wristwatch made with a sundial', 'Buster playing an impromptu game of craps with dice with Roman numerals on the sides', 'and him pulling his chariot up to a \"No parking\" sign in Latin (naturally', 'mistranslating Non Postum Exit). The best gag was when he engages in a chariot race in the hippodrome using one pulled by dogs. When one starts slowing down', 'he replaces it like a spare tire with another that's stashed in his trunk', 'which was hilarious.The Modern Age of \"speed', 'need', 'and greed\" features some amusing moments on the gridiron', 'like Buster being propped up by an opponent so he can be knocked down each play', 'and handing the ball off when he's about to be creamed on a punt return. There's also a clever getaway shot from above where he goes through one taxi to another faced in the opposite direction', 'and when the two cabs drive off', 'his pursuers think he's in the first. Nothing tops that extraordinary leap from one building to another', 'however', 'where Buster missed the jump in real life. While there was a safety net 35 feet below him', 'he hit it hard and awkwardly enough that he injured his knees', 'hips', 'and elbows', 'and had to stay in bed for several days afterwards. How he then improvised the awnings and slid into the fire department was brilliant', 'and \"the biggest laughing sequence in the picture...because I missed it in the original trick', '\" as he put it.Overall the film wasn't helped by being so drawn out as the pace of the jokes probably could have been faster', 'but there's a lot to like here. Pretty cute ending too.', 'First time of seeing Buster Keaton's first feature film and I have to admit I liked it a lot and only wish I'd stumbled across it years ago. The Rohauer blurb at the start warns that the Three Ages single nitrate print was rediscovered and salvaged in 1954 just in time before combustion', 'and many frames that seemed hopelessly glued together were separated. So', 'it's rocky viewing in places', 'but I've seen and survived much worse.It would have been OK as the 3 short films but as a take on Intolerance it's inventive and funny from the start to the finish: In the Stone Age with baddie Wallace Beery riding an elephant and goodie Buster riding a pet brontosaurus; In the Roman Age Buster riding a chariot with wheel locks and adapted for sledging', 'No Parking signs in Latin; In this technological Age of Speed Need and Greed his car beautifully falls to bits at the first hump. Both him and Beery are after the Girl through the ages', 'a never ending tussle. Favourite bit: As the caveman he gets knocked backward over a cliff edge but still blows a kiss to the camera - an amazing second or two!Great stuff', 'reaffirming my love of silent film comedy.', 'This is a pleasant and funny combination of slapstick and satire', 'period humor and romantic comedy.  It does not have quite the number of sustained chase/stunt sequences as in most of Keaton's features', 'but instead there are a lot of fine subtle gags of all different kinds.In each of the \"Three Ages\"', 'Buster and Wallace Beery vie for the affections of the same woman', 'with amusing and unpredictable results.  The simple romantic triangle theme sets up a lot of good material', 'on the one hand lending itself to a lot of gags about the unchanging nature of romantic courtship', 'and on the other hand being used for a lot of deliberate anachronisms that are often extremely funny.  Beery makes a nice foil for Keaton', 'and the girl's parents also have some good moments.This one usually gets lost in the crowd among so many brilliant Keaton masterpieces', 'but it works very well and is definitely worth seeing for any fan of silent comedy.', 'For me', 'Keaton's decision to make a parody of Griffith's Intolerance so that if the feature (his first) failed he could re-edit and release it as three two-reelers is what diminishes the enjoyment for me. The film jumps back and forth between the three time periods', 'and so all of them seem to be over before they've really begun', 'and the film has something of a disjointed feel. Perhaps this is because the film does actually feel as if it is three two-reelers spliced together rather than an actual feature.The comedy is unevenly paced', 'but when it hits the mark it is near-perfect. Highlights include Keaton's drunken encounter with Wallace Beery', 'other diners', 'and a crab at a restaurant', 'and the jaw-dropping leap from one roof to another at what looks like hundreds of feet above the ground (apparently the buildings were short sets placed on a bridge overlooking a view of Los Angeles. Just as well', 'because Keaton failed to make the leap successfully and fell from the second building', 'a real-life mishap that remains in the film). Keaton slides through a window', 'across a room', 'down a pole (at this point we realise he is in a fire station although he doesn't) and lands on the back of a fire engine that returns him to the police station from which he has just escaped. The whole sequence is both side-splitting and astounding. The look on Keaton's face as he looks quizzically up at the pole he has just descended is priceless. Perhaps because of his status as a comic genius we tend to forget how good an actor Keaton was .I liked the modern sequence best', 'and had it been released as a short I believe it would be considered one of his classics. The caveman sequence is OK', 'but the Roman era story tends to drag.It's been well publicised that this was competition winner Margaret Leahy's only film because she was so untalented as an actress', 'and it's true she doesn't light any fires while on-screen. But the impact of her ineptitude in front of the camera is cleverly avoided by the likes of Keaton and Beery merely acting around her as if she were just another prop.Overall', 'this isn't one of Keaton's best - although that is probably because this is his first feature. Keaton himself thought it was just OK and', 'given his instinctive sense for what works', 'perhaps that should tell us all we need to know...']

the, modern, age, i, liked, them, in, that, order, too, with, more, laughs, with, the, older, periods, of, time, although, i, laughed, at, the, hardest, at, a, couple, of, segments, in, the, roman, age, my, favorite, was, the, chariot, race, held, in, the, sand, that, had, a, number, of, clever, things, in, the, segment, the, brief, bit, with, the, lion, was, funny, too, sort, of, a, parody, of, the, biblical, story, of, daniel, in, the, lion, s, den, they, were, smart, only, going, five, minutes, or, so, with, each, age, and, then, going, back, with, the, story, each, time, each, age, had, four, or, five, segments, in, total, nothing, hilarious, but, definitely, worth, your, time, if, you, are, checking, out, silent, film, comedies, buster, presents, love, stories, from, three, periods, in, history, the, stone, age, the, roman, age, and, the, modern, age, in, each, he, vies, for, the, affection, of, a, young, woman, with, another, man, thus, illustrating, that, emotions, like, love, and, jealousy, have, been, constant, for, time, immemorial, a, contrast, to, what, d, w, griffith, was, trying, to, highlight, in, intolerance, which, buster, was, parodying, while, the, three, stories, are, interleaved, together, it, s, notable, that, at, a, 63, minute, runtime, this, is, essentially, three, two, reel, shorts, put, together, as, keaton, put, it, cut, the, film, apart, and, then, splice, up, the, three, periods, each, one, separately, and, you, will, have, three, complete, two, reel, films, the, stone, age, story, has, lots, of, gags, that, the, flintstones, would, later, borrow, such, as, prehistoric, golfing, taking, dictation, by, chiseling, into, a, stone, and, presenting, a, business, card, comprised, of, a, small, slab, of, rock, with, a, crude, likeness, drawn, on, it, buster, standing, atop, a, dinosaur, despite, the, bad, science, and, primitive, stop, motion, effects, made, me, smile, the, best, moment, however, was, when, he, tries, to, arouse, jealousy, in, his, beloved, by, attempting, to, grab, another, woman, by, the, hair, and, take, charge, of, her, only, to, find, she, s, at, least, a, foot, taller, than, him, she, knocks, him, off, the, rock, and, we, get, that, marvelous, shot, of, him, look, up, into, the, camera, on, the, way, down, to, a, pond, below, kissing, his, fingers, before, spreading, his, arms, wide, the, roman, age, story, has, a, lot, of, the, same, types, of, visual, gags, like, a, wristwatch, made, with, a, sundial, buster, playing, an, impromptu, game, of, craps, with, dice, with, roman, numerals, on, the, sides, and, him, pulling, his, chariot, up, to, a, no, parking, sign, in, latin, naturally, mistranslating, non, postum, exit, the, best, gag, was, when, he, engages, in, a, chariot, race, in, the, hippodrome, using, one, pulled, by, dogs, when, one, starts, slowing, down, he, replaces, it, like, a, spare, tire, with, another, that, s, stashed, in, his, trunk, which, was, hilarious, the, modern, age, of, speed, need, and, greed, features, some, amusing, moments, on, the, gridiron, like, buster, being, propped, up, by, an, opponent, so, he, can, be, knocked, down, each, play, and, handing, the, ball, off, when, he, s, about, to, be, creamed, on, a, punt, return, there, s, also, a, clever, getaway, shot, from, above, where, he, goes, through, one, taxi, to, another, faced, in, the, opposite, direction, and, when, the, two, cabs, drive, off, his, pursuers, think, he, s, in, the, first, nothing, tops, that, extraordinary, leap, from, one, building, to, another, however, where, buster, missed, the, jump, in, real, life, while, there, was, a, safety, net, 35, feet, below, him, he, hit, it, hard, and, awkwardly, enough, that, he, injured, his, knees, hips, and, elbows, and, had, to, stay, in, bed, for, several, days, afterwards, how, he, then, improvised, the, awnings, and, slid, into, the, fire, department, was, brilliant, and, the, biggest, laughing, sequence, in, the, picture, because, i, missed, it, in, the, original, trick, as, he, put, it, overall, the, film, wasn, t, helped, by, being, so, drawn, out, as, the, pace, of, the, jokes, probably, could, have, been, faster, but, there, s, a, lot, to, like, here, pretty, cute, ending, too, first, time, of, seeing, buster, keaton, s, first, feature, film, and, i, have, to, admit, i, liked, it, a, lot, and, only, wish, i, d, stumbled, across, it, years, ago, the, rohauer, blurb, at, the, start, warns, that, the, three, ages, single, nitrate, print, was, rediscovered, and, salvaged, in, 1954, just, in, time, before, combustion, and, many, frames, that, seemed, hopelessly, glued, together, were, separated, so, it, s, rocky, viewing, in, places, but, i, ve, seen, and, survived, much, worse, it, would, have, been, ok, as, the, 3, short, films, but, as, a, take, on, intolerance, it, s, inventive, and, funny, from, the, start, to, the, finish, in, the, stone, age, with, baddie, wallace, beery, riding, an, elephant, and, goodie, buster, riding, a, pet, brontosaurus, in, the, roman, age, buster, riding, a, chariot, with, wheel, locks, and, adapted, for, sledging, no, parking, signs, in, latin, in, this, technological, age, of, speed, need, and, greed, his, car, beautifully, falls, to, bits, at, the, first, hump, both, him, and, beery, are, after, the, girl, through, the, ages, a, never, ending, tussle, favourite, bit, as, the, caveman, he, gets, knocked, backward, over, a, cliff, edge, but, still, blows, a, kiss, to, the, camera, an, amazing, second, or, two, great, stuff, reaffirming, my, love, of, silent, film, comedy, this, is, a, pleasant, and, funny, combination, of, slapstick, and, satire, period, humor, and, romantic, comedy, it, does, not, have, quite, the, number, of, sustained, chase, stunt, sequences, as, in, most, of, keaton, s, features, but, instead, there, are, a, lot, of, fine, subtle, gags, of, all, different, kinds, in, each, of, the, three, ages, buster, and, wallace, beery, vie, for, the, affections, of, the, same, woman, with, amusing, and, unpredictable, results, the, simple, romantic, triangle, theme, sets, up, a, lot, of, good, material, on, the, one, hand, lending, itself, to, a, lot, of, gags, about, the, unchanging, nature, of, romantic, courtship, and, on, the, other, hand, being, used, for, a, lot, of, deliberate, anachronisms, that, are, often, extremely, funny, beery, makes, a, nice, foil, for, keaton, and, the, girl, s, parents, also, have, some, good, moments, this, one, usually, gets, lost, in, the, crowd, among, so, many, brilliant, keaton, masterpieces, but, it, works, very, well, and, is, definitely, worth, seeing, for, any, fan, of, silent, comedy, for, me, keaton, s, decision, to, make, a, parody, of, griffith, s, intolerance, so, that, if, the, feature, his, first, failed, he, could, re, edit, and, release, it, as, three, two, reelers, is, what, diminishes, the, enjoyment, for, me, the, film, jumps, back, and, forth, between, the, three, time, periods, and, so, all, of, them, seem, to, be, over, before, they, ve, really, begun, and, the, film, has, something, of, a, disjointed, feel, perhaps, this, is, because, the, film, does, actually, feel, as, if, it, is, three, two, reelers, spliced, together, rather, than, an, actual, feature, the, comedy, is, unevenly, paced, but, when, it, hits, the, mark,

In this movie', 'you get great comedy. There are some sequences in this film that almost reach the classics of Safety Last or Girl Shy for Lloyd. Granted', 'there are a few spots early which are slow', 'but the uniqueness of how Lloyd plays off in the revolution & with the Giant are so classic that you almost forget the slow start the film has.Actually', 'considering the film Lloyd did after this was Girl Shy', 'the split with Roach really did not slow him down', 'he sped up even faster. Still', 'this was the finish for the producer who discovered Harold & had taken him this far. It is so sad that thanks to the split', 'Harold owned all his films & a wholegeneration of American movie goers forgot he existed. I am so glad in recent years that we have been allowed to rediscover this talent. When you watch his films', 'you realize how much others who came much later actually were copying pieces of Harolds work in their own films. Remember The Bank Dick chase sequence? Harold did it first in Girl Shy. Remember the race to the church at the end of The Graduate? Lloyd did it first in Girl Shy & then consulted with Mike Nichols to do it again in the successful 1960's film. Forgotten genius describes Lloyd aptly & even though this is a notch below Safety Last & Girl Shy', 'it is well worth viewing.', 'Heavily medicated millionaire hypochondriac Harold Van Pelham (Harold Lloyd) is sent to Paradiso', 'a tropical island nation off South America', 'for his health. He brings along his adoring nurse and his valet Mr. Pipps. American Jim Blake leads a band of renegades against the sleepy government. Upon arrival', 'Harold is mistaken for an expected government representative. He escapes the firing squad with the help of wild giant fellow prisoner Colosso.It's a cute little comedy. The first laugh comes as Harold tries to pull Colosso's tooth. It's extended slapstick fun for a simple premise. The giant is great visual contrast and a fun comedy partner. I don't know if he ever worked with Harold after this. They're certainly good together here although Harold is a little mean sometimes. There's a difference between cluelessness and callousness. As a rich self-obsessed character', 'he often drifts into the later. There is plenty of great physical comedy although it's missing a final one big stunt.', 'The zaniest', 'most cartoonlike of all Harold Lloyd features recaptures the energetic anarchy of his wilder short subjects while at the same time drawing from the sort of satirical innocent-ugly-American-abroad adventures that Douglas Fairbanks and Anita Loos had popularized in the teens.Lloyd plays an obtuse millionaire hypochondriac who \"has taken so many pills he rattles when he walks.\" He blunders into a banana republic's revolution and must defeat a dictatorial regime backed by an unscrupulous Yankee. Along the way', 'he faces up to his imaginary ills and falls for his spunky', 'long-suffering nurse -- ably played by the quietly sexy Jobyna Ralston in her first feature as Lloyd's love interest. But the real star is John Aase n -- all eight feet', 'nine and a half inches of him -- who makes an excellent 503 pound mad hermit', 'buddying up with Lloyd for some of the most improbable and unrelenting sight gag sequences ever put on film -- among them', 'an extended effort to pull the giant's aching tooth.The setting is obviously Latin America (and', 'in fact', 'the whole film functions nicely as propaganda', 'artfully fudging the United States' imperial subjugation of the region by focusing on a single American villain) but when real-life Mexicans earnestly protested the film's stereotypes', 'Lloyd responded by changing the intertitles to suggest that the whole thing takes place on a mythical island. I can't imagine anyone was fooled by this since the Latino stereotypes still dominate the film: lazy peasants', 'greasy strongmen', 'etc.Why Worry? grossed slightly less at the box office than Lloyd's previous film', 'Safety Last (almost $1.5 million vs. almost $1.6 million)', 'and cost about a hundred thousand dollars more to make (almost $221', '000 vs. almost $121', '000). It was his last film for producer Hal Roach. Lloyd went on to make his next ten films independently for release through distributors like Pathe', 'Paramount and Fox -- but despite a few wild sequences in films like Hot Water and For Heaven's Sake', 'he never again made a picture quite as snappy and offbeat as Why Worry?If the film looks back to Fairbanks', 'it looks ahead to the hypochondriac heroes of Broadway's The Nervous Wreck and its film versions', 'including Eddie Cantor's Whoopee! and Danny Kaye's Up in Arms', 'not to mention the mythical political intrigue of W. C. Fields' Million Dollar Legs', 'the Marx Brothers' Duck Soup', 'Woody Allen's Bananas', 'and much else in the realm of American low comedy.', 'I had watched this in Hollywood as well but', 'given its late-night broadcast (being the last of 7 Lloyd films shown in a row)', 'I was quite tired when its turn came and therefore not in the best position to appreciate it!Lloyd is a spoilt millionaire and a hypochondriac to boot - not his typical struggling character therefore', 'but just as resourceful in dealing with situations beyond his control; he goes to a supposedly peaceful South American republic for health reasons and finds it torn by revolution! This film', 'then', 'would seem to be the precursor of all the south-of-the-border comedies which came much later - for instance Woody Allen's BANANAS (1971).Still', 'while the comic action scenes at the climax certainly deliver the goods - Lloyd is assisted by a giant he met while in prison (and whom he had rid of a crippling toothache) - I think that the film is at its best during the earlier stages (especially the hilarious scene in which', 'taking a stroll around the village streets', 'he admires the leisurely lifestyle of the simple-folk there - with everyone he meets apparently sound asleep', 'unaware that their predicament is actually the result of a fresh beating by the oppressive militia!). Incidentally', 'this was Jobyna Ralston's first film with Lloyd (playing his loving nurse who', 'at one point', 'is disguised as a Mexican serving-boy in order to escape the lecherous attentions of the chief villain!).', 'A rich', 'young hypochondriac figures WHY WORRY? As long as he's got his nurse & valet to look after him absolutely nothing could happen', 'right?Harold Lloyd', 'one of America's preeminent comedians of the Silent Era', 'uses his remarkable comic skills and tremendous athletic abilities to score another solid hit in this tale full of adventurous hilarity. With remarkable nonchalance', 'he calmly proceeds to thwart a Latin American revolution which threatens to shatter the tranquility of his restful vacation. But once his temper is aroused--at the sight of a distraught female--he really becomes a two-fisted hero eager to take on any number of bad guys.Special mention should be made of Minnesota-born Norwegian-American John Aasen (1887-1938)', 'who in his film debut plays Harold's gigantic companion. Nearly nine feet tall & rather fearsome', 'he nonetheless almost immediately grabs the viewer's complete sympathy while suffering mightily from a raging toothache. Gentle with Harold', 'he becomes an unstoppable one-man army in dealing with their enemies.This film marked a milestone of sorts for Harold. It was his last produced in collaboration with Hal Roach; their friendly parting allowed Harold to gain virtually complete control over his films. WHY WORRY? was also his first movie to feature his new costar', 'beautiful Jobyna Ralston', 'who delivers a feisty', 'compelling performance as Harold's nurse; his previous leading lady', 'Mildred Davis', 'was now very busy in her new life as Mrs. Harold Lloyd.Robert Israel has composed an excellent film score which perfectly complements Harold's antics on the screen.']

that, almost, reach, the, classics, of, safety, last, or, girl, shy, for, lloyd, granted, there, are, a, few, spots, early, which, are, slow, but, the, uniqueness, of, how, lloyd, plays, off, in, the,

with, roach, really, did, not, slow, him, down, he, sped, up, even, faster, still, this, was, the, finish, for, the, producer, who, discovered, harold, had, taken, him, this, far, it, is, so, sad, that, thanks, to, the, split, harold, owned, all, his, films, a, wholegeneration, of, american, movie, goers, forgot, he, existed, i, am, so, glad, in, recent, years, that, we, have, been, allowed, to, rediscover, this, talent, when, you, watch, his, films, you, realize, how, much, others, who, came, much, later, actually, were, copying, pieces, of, harolds, work, in, their, own, films, remember, the, bank, dick, chase, sequence, harold, did, it, first, in, girl, shy, remember, the, race, to, the, church, at, the, end, of, the, graduate, lloyd, did, it, first, in, girl, shy, then, consulted, with, mike, nichols, to, do, it, again, in, the, successful, 1960, s, film, forgotten, genius, describes, lloyd, aptly, even, though, this, is, a, notch, below, safety, last, girl, shy, it,

as, harold, tries, to, pull, colosso, s, tooth, it, s, extended, slapstick, fun, for, a, simple, premise, the, giant, is, great, visual, contrast, and, a, fun, comedy, partner, i, don, t, know, if, he, ever, worked, with, harold, after, this, they, re, certainly, good, together, here, although, harold, is, a, little, mean, sometimes, there, s, a, difference, between, cluelessness, and, callousness, as, a, rich, self, obsessed, character, he, often, drifts, into, the, later, there, is, plenty, of, great, physical, comedy, although, it, s, missing, a, final, one, big, stunt, the, zaniest, most, cartoonlike, of, all, harold, lloyd, features, recaptures, the, energetic, anarchy, of, his, wilder, short, subjects, while, at, the, same, time, drawing, from, the, sort, of, satirical, innocent, ugly, american, abroad, adventures, that, douglas, fairbanks, and, anita, loos, had, popularized, in, the, teens, lloyd, plays, an, obtuse, millionaire, hypochondriac, who, has, taken, so, many, pills, he, rattles, when, he, walks, he, blunders, into, a, banana, republic, s, revolution, and, must, defeat, a, dictatorial, regime, backed, by, an, unscrupulous, yankee, along, the, way, he, faces, up, to, his, imaginary, ills, and, falls, for, his, spunky, long, suffering, nurse, ably, played, by, the, quietly, sexy, jobyna, ralston, in, her, first, feature, as, lloyd, s, love, interest, but, the, real, star, is, john, aase, n, all, eight, feet, nine, and, a, half, inches, of, him, who, makes, an, excellent, 503, pound, mad, hermit, buddying, up, with, lloyd, for, some, of, the, most, improbable, and, unrelenting, sight, gag, sequences, ever, put, on, film, among, them, an, extended, effort, to, pull, the, giant, s, aching, tooth, the, setting, is, obviously, latin, america, and, in, fact, the, whole, film, functions, nicely, as, propaganda, artfully, fudging, the, united, states, imperial, subjugation, of, the, region, by, focusing, on, a, single, american, villain, but, when, real, life, mexicans, earnestly, protested, the, film, s, stereotypes, lloyd, responded, by, changing, the, intertitles, to, suggest, that, the, whole, thing, takes, place, on, a, mythical, island, i, can, t, imagine, anyone, was, fooled, by, this, since, the, latino, stereotypes, still, dominate, the, film, lazy, peasants, greasy, strongmen, etc, why, worry, grossed, slightly, less, at, the, box, office, than, lloyd, s, previous, film, safety, last, almost, 1, 5, million, vs, almost, 1, 6, million, and, cost, about, a, hundred, thousand, dollars, more, to, make, almost, 221, 000, vs, almost, 121, 000, it, was, his, last, film, for, producer, hal, roach, lloyd, went, on, to, make, his, next, ten, films, independently, for, release, through, distributors, like, pathe, paramount, and, fox, but, despite, a, few, wild, sequences, in, films, like, hot, water, and, for, heaven, s, sake, he, never, again, made, a, picture, quite, as, snappy, and, offbeat, as, why, worry, if, the, film, looks, back, to, fairbanks, it, looks, ahead, to, the, hypochondriac, heroes, of, broadway, s, the, nervous, wreck, and, its, film, versions, including, eddie, cantor, s, whoopee, and, danny, kaye, s, up, in, arms, not, to, mention, the, mythical, political, intrigue, of, w, c, fields, million, dollar, legs, the, marx, brothers, duck, soup, woody, allen, s, bananas, and, much, else, in, the, realm, of, american, low, comedy, i, had, watched, this, in, hollywood, as, well, but, given, its, late, night, broadcast, being, the, last, of, 7, lloyd, films, shown, in, a, row, i, was, quite, tired, when, its, turn, came, and, therefore, not, in, the, best, position, to, appreciate, it, lloyd, is, a, spoilt, millionaire, and, a, hypochondriac, to, boot, not, his, typical, struggling, character, therefore, but, just, as, resourceful, in, dealing, with, situations, beyond, his, control, he, goes, to, a, supposedly, peaceful, south, american, republic, for, health, reasons, and, finds, it, torn, by, revolution, this, film, then, would, seem, to, be, the, precursor, of, all, the, south, of, the, border, comedies, which, came, much, later, for, instance, woody, allen, s, bananas, 1971, still, while, the, comic, action, scenes, at, the, climax, certainly, deliver, the, goods, lloyd, is, assisted, by, a, giant, he, met, while, in, prison, and, whom, he, had, rid, of, a, crippling, toothache, i, think, that, the, film, is, at, its, best, during, the, earlier, stages, especially, the, hilarious, scene, in, which, taking, a, stroll, around, the, village, streets, he, admires, the, leisurely, lifestyle, of, the, simple, folk, there, with, everyone, he, meets, apparently, sound, asleep, unaware, that, their, predicament, is, actually, the, result, of, a, fresh, beating, by, the, oppressive, militia, incidentally, this, was, jobyna, ralston, s, first, film, with, lloyd, playing, his, loving, nurse, who, at, one, point, is, disguised, as, a, mexican, serving, boy, in, order, to, escape, the, lecherous, attentions, of, the, chief, villain, a, rich, young, hypochondriac, figures, why, worry, as, long, as, he, s, got, his, nurse, valet, to, look, after, him, absolutely, nothing, could, happen, right, harold, lloyd, one, of, america, s, preeminent, comedians, of, the, silent, era, uses, his, remarkable, comic, skills, and, tremendous, athletic, abilities, to, score, another, solid, hit, in, this, tale, full, of, adventurous, hilarity, with, remarkable, nonchalance, he, calmly, proceeds, to, thwart, a, latin, american, revolution, which, threatens, to, shatter, the, tranquility, of, his, restful, vacation, but, once, his, temper, is, aroused, at, the, sight, of, a, distraught, female, he, really, becomes, a, two, fisted, hero, eager, to, take, on, any, number, of, bad, guys, special, mention, should, be, made, of, minnesota, born, norwegian, american, john, aasen, 1887, 1938, who, in, his, film, debut, plays, harold, s, gigantic, companion, nearly, nine, feet, tall, rather, fearsome, he, nonetheless, almost, immediately, grabs, the, viewer, s, complete, sympathy, while, suffering, mightily, from, a, raging, toothache, gentle, with, harold, he, becomes, an, unstoppable, one, man, army, in, dealing, with, their, enemies, this, film, marked, a, milestone, of, sorts, for, harold, it, was, his, last, produced, in, collaboration, with, hal, roach, their, friendly, parting, allowed, harold, to, gain, virtually, complete, control, over, his, films, why, worry, was, also, his, first, movie, to, feature, his, new, costar, beautiful, jobyna, ralston, who, delivers, a, feisty, compelling, performance, as, harold, s, nurse, his, previous, leading, lady, mildred, davis, was, now, very, busy, in, her, new, life, as, mrs, harold, lloyd, robert, israel, has, composed, an, excellent, film, score, which, perfectly, complements, harold, s, antics, on, the, screen]

Every gag is so closed linked to another.  It really leaves you marvel at his ability of building up and controlling his work. Besides', 'it is one of the great romantic comedies of the silent era', 'full of breath-taking imageries(like the scene when the Boy was dreaming about the Girl while fishing under a bridge..).  It is hilarious throughout(especially for those 2 fantasy sequences). The great final chase is full of typical thrills that only Lloyd's comedy can provide(and', 'as we know it', '`inspired' the final chase in The Graduate). Lloyd showed some wonderful drama acting ability too(when he had to dissuade the Girl from seeing him any more).', 'I had watched this for the first time while I was in Hollywood as part of a TCM marathon of Harold Lloyd films in November 2005 (to coincide with the DVD release of New Line's 7-Disc Set). I must say that in the past I had underestimated it', 'because I did not pick up the \"Connoiseur Video\" PAL VHS a few years ago (as I had done with 3 other available titles by this great comedian). The plot deals with a painfully shy tailor's apprentice (he stutters terribly at the sight of a woman) who has secretly published a lovers' manual', 'and himself falls for a wealthy girl (the demure but utterly charming Jobyna Ralston', 'a frequent Lloyd co-star) who is about to be married off to a bigamist heel.The film displays dazzling invention throughout and is frequently hilarious', 'but also laces the proceedings with just the right dose of sentiment: the climactic exhilarating chase is spectacular and one of the very best of its kind', 'while the disruption of the marriage/abduction of the bride ending might well have inspired THE GRADUATE (1967)! Some of the funniest stuff includes: the fantasy sequences depicting Lloyd as an irresistible ladies' man', 'illustrating his theories on how to seduce a vamp and a flapper; the car exchange sequence (which sees Lloyd losing the ramshackle vehicle he ended up with down a cliff); and his hitching a clandestine ride on a car which is about to be parked in its garage.', 'Long live Harold! This is a charming silent comedy where my hero plays a shy boy writing a book about the ways to seduce a woman. He wants to publish it', 'but the editor thinks this is a funny book.  In his way', 'Harold fells in love with a beautiful young woman. This love helps him to stop being girl shy. Very funny gags', 'and also a sensitive way to illustrate love (such beautiful scenes are frequents in Harold's movie). This is also a great opportunity to see the beauty and the talent of the wonderful Jobyna Ralston.  See it! And see all the Harold Lloyd movies of the 1920's! He was and still is one of the best comic actors in Hollywood history.', 'I have not seen very many Harold Lloyd movies', 'but if this film is any indication of his massive talent', 'I need to remedy that as soon as possible.Harold is wonderful as Harold Meadows', 'a man so shy around women that he stutters until a whistle is blown. He is at work on a book about seducing women strangely enough and the imaginary scenes of him using his \"techniques\" on both a Vampire (Vamp) and a Flapper are early indications that this is going to be a very funny film.The plot has been more than ably shared already', 'I will just add a few short observations.It was a treat to see some of the earliest Our Gang / Little Rascal kids in this movie. In the opening scene in the tailor shop the wild-haired boy getting his pants stitched is Jackie Condon and the cute', 'chubby boy sitting on the floor is the first Our Gang \"Fat Kid\" ', 'Joe Cobb. Later during the chase scene as Harold is riding horses', 'a freckle-faced boy calls out a cheer', 'this is Mickey Daniels', 'also of Our Gang fame.I enjoyed', 'as everyone seems to of course', 'the chase/race at the end. It seems that they purposely used every form of land transport known at the time to get Harold to the place he needed to be.Early product placement? Crackerjack boxes play a major role in this film.All in all', 'this was am excellent introduction to Harold Lloyd for me', 'it makes me want to see more. I recommend it highly!', 'Although painfully GIRL SHY', 'a tailor's assistant uses every ounce of strength to keep the young woman he adores from an unwise marriage.Harold Lloyd produces another winning entry in his series of silent screen comedy classics. This time there is a healthy dose of old-fashioned romanticism', 'as Harold and beautiful Jobyna Ralston yearn & commune alongside a bucolic stream.Such tenderness never cloys', 'however', 'as Lloyd makes sure to leaven it with healthy helpings of hilarity. His attempts to hide a small dog on a passenger train are uproarious', 'as are his demonstrations on how to make love to vamps & flappers. And when the viewer thinks Harold can't possibly top himself', 'he ends the film with one of his marvelous chase scenes', 'in which he uses every sort of conveyance (train', 'jalopy', 'horse', 'fire truck', 'trolley', 'motorcycle & sand wagon) to stop Jobyna's marriage to a cad.Throughout', 'Harold displays the remarkable athleticism for which he was celebrated', 'made even more astonishing when one remembers that he had lost half of his right hand a few years before in a freak studio accident', 'a disfigurement he disguised with a prosthetic glove.Movie mavens will recognize some OUR GANG kids in uncredited roles--Fat Joe Cobb & Jackie Condon in the tailor's shop and Mickey Daniels as a newsboy on the street.Jim Parker has composed an excellent film score which perfectly complements Harold's antics on the screen.']

that, tight, structure, as, the, trademark, of, his, comedy, is, most, obvious, every, gag, is, so, closed, linked, to, another, it, really, leaves, you, marvel, at, his, ability, of, building, up, and, controlling, his, work, besides, it, is, one, of, the, great, romantic, comedies, of, the, silent, era, full, of, breath, taking, imageries, like, the, scene, when, the, boy, was, dreaming, about, the, girl, while, fishing, under, a, bridge, it, is, hilarious, throughout, especially, for, those, 2, fantasy, sequences, the, great, final, chase, is, full, of, typical, thrills, that, only, lloyd, s, comedy, can, provide, and, as, we, know, it, inspired, the, final, chase, in, the, graduate, lloyd, showed, some, wonderful, drama, acting, ability, too, when, he, had, to, dissuade, the, girl, from, seeing, him, any, more, i, had, watched, this, for, the, first, time, while, i, was, in, hollywood, as, part, of, a, tcm, marathon, of, harold, lloyd, films, in, november, 2005, to, coincide, with, the, dvd, release, of, new, line, s, 7, disc, set, i, must, say, that, in, the, past, i, had, underestimated, it, because, i, did, not, pick, up, the, connoiseur, video, pal, vhs, a, few, years, ago, as, i, had, done, with, 3, other, available, titles, by, this, great, comedian, the, plot, deals, with, a, painfully, shy, tailor, s, apprentice, he, stutters, terribly, at, the, sight, of, a, woman, who, has, secretly, published, a, lovers, manual, and, himself, falls, for, a, wealthy, girl, the, demure, but, utterly, charming, jobyna, ralston, a, frequent, lloyd, co, star, who, is, about, to, be, married, off, to, a, bigamist, heel, the, film, displays, dazzling, invention, throughout, and, is, frequently, hilarious, but, also, laces, the, proceedings, with, just, the, right, dose, of, sentiment, the, climactic, exhilarating, chase, is, spectacular, and, one, of, the, very, best, of, its, kind, while, the, disruption, of, the, marriage, abduction, of, the, bride, ending, might, well, have, inspired, the, graduate, 1967, some, of, the, funniest, stuff, includes, the, fantasy, sequences, depicting, lloyd, as, an, irresistible, ladies, man, illustrating, his, theories, on, how, to, seduce, a, vamp, and, a, flapper, the, car, exchange, sequence, which, sees, lloyd, losing, the, ramshackle, vehicle, he, ended, up, with, down, a, cliff, and, his, hitching, a, clandestine, ride, on, a, car, which, is, about, to, be, parked, in, its, garage, long, live, harold, this, is, a, charming, silent, comedy, where, my, hero, plays, a, shy, boy, writing, a, book, about, the, ways, to, seduce, a, woman, he, wants, to, publish, it, but, the, editor, thinks, this, is, a, funny, book, in, his, way, harold, fells, in, love, with, a, beautiful, young, woman, this, love, helps, him, to, stop, being, girl, shy, very, funny, gags, and, also, a, sensitive, way, to, illustrate, love, such, beautiful, scenes, are, frequents, in, harold, s, movie, this, is, also, a, great, opportunity, to, see, the, beauty, and, the, talent, of, the, wonderful, jobyna, ralston, see, it, and, see, all, the, harold, lloyd, movies, of, the, 1920, s, he, was, and, still, is, one, of, the, best, comic, actors, in, hollywood, history, i, have, not, seen, very, many, harold, lloyd, movies, but, if, this, film, is, any, indication, of, his, massive, talent, i, need, to, remedy, that, as, soon, as, possible, harold, is, wonderful, as, harold, meadows, a, man, so, shy, around, women, that, he, stutters, until, a, whistle, is, blown, he, is, at, work, on, a, book, about, seducing, women, strangely, enough, and, the, imaginary, scenes, of, him, using, his, techniques, on, both, a, vampire, vamp, and, a, flapper, are, early, indications, that, this, is, going, to, be, a, very, funny, film, the, plot, has, been, more, than, ably, shared, already, i, will, just, add, a, few, short, observations, it, was, a, treat, to, see, some, of, the, earliest, our, gang, little, rascal, kids, in, this, movie, in, the, opening, scene, in, the, tailor, shop, the, wild, haired, boy, getting, his, pants, stitched, is, jackie, condon, and, the, cute, chubby, boy, sitting, on, the, floor, is, the, first, our, gang, fat, kid, joe, cobb, later, during, the, chase, scene, as, harold, is, riding, horses, a, freckle, faced, boy, calls, out, a, cheer, this, is, mickey, daniels, also, of, our, gang, fame, i, enjoyed, as, everyone, seems, to, of, course, the, chase, race, at, the, end, it, seems, that, they, purposely, used, every, form, of, land, transport, known, at, the, time, to, get, harold, to, the, place, he, needed, to, be, early, product, placement, crackerjack, boxes, play, a, major, role, in, this, film, all, in, all, this, was, am, excellent, introduction, to, harold, lloyd, for, me, it, makes, me, want, to, see, more, i, recommend, it, highly, although, painfully, girl, shy, a, tailor, s, assistant, uses, every, ounce, of, strength, to, keep, the, young, woman, he, adores, from, an, unwise, marriage, harold, lloyd, produces, another, winning, entry, in, his, series, of, silent, screen, comedy, classics, this, time, there, is, a, healthy, dose, of, old, fashioned, romanticism, as, harold, and, beautiful, jobyna, ralston, yearn, commune, alongside, a, bucolic, stream, such, tenderness, never, cloys, however, as, lloyd, makes, sure, to, leaven, it, with, healthy, helpings, of, hilarity, his, attempts, to, hide, a, small, dog, on, a, passenger, train, are, uproarious, as, are, his, demonstrations, on, how, to, make, love, to, vamps, flappers, and, when, the, viewer, thinks, harold, can, t, possibly, top, himself, he, ends, the, film, with, one, of, his, marvelous, chase, scenes, in, which, he, uses, every, sort, of, conveyance, train, jalopy, horse, fire, truck, trolley, motorcycle, sand, wagon, to, stop, jobyna, s, marriage, to, a, cad, throughout, harold, displays, the, remarkable, athleticism, for, which, he, was, celebrated, made, even, more, astonishing, when, one, remembers, that, he, had, lost, half, of, his, right, hand, a, few, years, before, in, a, freak, studio, accident, a, disfigurement, he, disguised, with, a, prosthetic, glove, movie, mavens, will, recognize, some, our, gang, kids, in, uncredited, roles, fat, joe, cobb, jackie, condon, in, the, tailor, s, shop, and, mickey, daniels, as, a, newsboy, on,

I came across the Criterion edition of the movie in a large collection of Laserdiscs that I purchased recently', 'and decided to give it a try. I was speechless.'The Last Laugh' (or 'The Last Man'', 'as its translation would lead you to believe', 'is a touching story from director F.W. Murnau about an un-named Hotel Porter & Doorman (played excellently by Emil Jannings) who', 'through no fault of his own', 'is demoted to Lavatory attendant', 'and we hereby watch as his life collapses around him. It's an incredibly emotional story - during his downfall', 'as his friends and family mock him', 'Jannings' depressed', 'hunched-over figure can be painfully sad to watch. I found myself filling up in the scene when he finally hands his beloved porter's uniform over to the night watchman.A landmark in the era of silent films', 'Murnau used some very clever camera tricks (such as smearing vaseline on the camera lens for 'dream' sequences). It was also one of the first films to use a completely free moving camera with no tripod', 'testimony to the success of this can be seen immediately in the first scene as the film starts. There are also no title cards in the film. Nor are they needed - The story is carried perfectly by the actors and on no occasion do you feel that you don't know what is going on.I won't give anything away here', 'but there are some people that may feel the ending is a little out of place - However', 'I had grown so fond on Jannings' character that in a way', 'I was relieved to see the film move on from the final scene where he is sat hunched on the seat in the washroom - and for him to finally have 'The Last Laugh' so to speak :o)If you have any interest in old cinema', 'and have not seen this', 'or just fancy a change from all of the samey Hollywood flicks being churned out right now', 'I suggest you hunt out a copy right away. Highly recommended.', 'F.W Murnau is best known for his expressionistic horror movies', 'such as 'Nosferatu' and the excellent 'Faust'. This movie is somewhat different from those', 'as it's a more personal and down to earth sort of tale. Still', 'despite this not being a member of the horror genre; Murnau's style still allows for much of the great visuals that made his horror movies great. The story itself has definite horror elements', 'which although they don't involve vampires or the devil; are arguably more frightening', 'as it dictates and event that could well happen to anyone. The film tackles the idea of 'downfall'', 'and as the prologue states; one can be a prince one day', 'but what is he tomorrow? This tale is told through the story of a hotel porter that has worked hard all his life but loses his job through incredible bad luck when the manager catches him taking a break. Heartbroken and humiliated', 'our hero is offered another job; but it only allows for his humiliation to continue', 'as the job is that of a lowly bathroom attendant. We then follow his struggle as he comes to terms with his loss and the reaction of his family and neighbours.F.W. Murnau uses no story cards for this silent film', 'which shows his flair for storytelling. Imagining some of today's 'great' filmmakers telling a story without dialogue is preposterous', 'but Murnau shows his prowess by doing just that', 'and doing it down to a fine art. People often cite 'Citizen Kane' for being the film that took storytelling to the next level', 'and although it did do that; surely some of the credit has to go to F.W. Murnau. This film features what is perhaps the first ever fantasy sequence', 'a sequence that is', 'of course', 'a favourite of today's cinema. Murnau's technical mastery is also shown in many other sequences', 'including one in particular that sees a scene appear in the middle of a letter. It's quite unbelievable that this was made over eighty years ago', 'just due to the amazing work on show in the film.The film falls down a bit towards the end', 'because of an ill-advised twist. This was put upon F.W. Murnau by the studio releasing the film', 'who wanted a happy ending. This is just another example of a studio spoiling a great movie', 'and even before I saw that piece of information in the trivia section for this movie; it was evident to me that it isn't the way that Murnau wanted to take the story from the way it almost appeared to be tacked on to the end of the film. Still', 'the hour and ten minutes running up the ending are almost as good as silent cinema gets', 'and in spite of the studio's best efforts to ruin it; The Last Laugh stands tall as on of Murnau's finest films.', 'People seem compelled to speak in superlative-terms when talking about the great directors; which film is their greatest', 'which ones are underrated', 'etc. But this is a film so simple in its themes', 'so modest in its methods', 'that it doesn't lend itself to these labels very easily.\"Nosferatu\" was revolutionary', 'but based on intensity', 'something that doesn't age very well. Other directors took up this notion of visual intensity (Leni', 'Boese) but structuralized it', 'and created the real German Horror masterpieces (\"Waxworks', '\" \"Golem\"). Murnau's discovery came later', 'with this film. That film narrative wasn't something that you followed linearly', 'but something you become immersed in. The lack of title-cards is not a gimmick', 'but a conscious decision not to interrupt the flow of this immersion. Reading is rational (hearing', 'slightly less so) and prevents this from taking place.Add a Gogolian tale of aging and dignity', 'and Murnau makes magic. This is what \"touching\" and \"moving\" films should be like.4 out of 5 - An excellent film', 'The camera work and the sets in this film where so breathtaking and powerful that they changed the film language forever. It is in many ways the Citizen Kane of its time.It was so revolutionary that Hollywood (Fox) tried desperately to get Murnau to work for them and teach them how to do all these things (which he did some years later). The main revolutionary thing was the fluidity of the camera (or the unchanged camera', 'as it was called). There was no steady cam at this time', 'but still they managed to strap the camera to the body of the cameraman without getting a shaky pictures.The set is just amazing. It is difficult to believe that this is not a real city. All the special effects help also to make this believable (special effects that are still today astonishing and believable).The makeup is also great. Emil Jannings was only 40 years old when he made this film but he really looks like an old man (and acts like one too).But the greatest thing about this film is how much Murnau manages to say with out the help of inter titles. This is visual storytelling at it's best.Murnau had come a long way from Nosferatu but he still had a long way to go and a lot to teach us before his untimely death. The Last Laugh is not only one of his best films', 'it is also most likely his most important one', 'and one of the most important films in film history.', 'This classic is distinctive in several respects.  The expressionistic style and creative camera work', 'along with a noteworthy leading performance by Emil Jannings', 'turn a simple story into a thought-provoking experience.  It is also very interesting for its almost complete lack of title cards', 'demonstrating how a skilled practitioner of the art of silent cinema can convey all kinds of attitudes and emotions without employing dialogue of any kind.The actual story is very simple.  Jannings portrays a doorman at a fine hotel', 'who takes enormous pride in his position', 'his work', 'and especially his uniform.  One day the hotel manager passes by', 'misunderstands what he sees', 'and decides that the doorman is too old for the job.  The next day', 'a new doorman takes his place', 'and he is relegated to working in the washroom. The rest of the film then shows the effect of this change on the doorman and on the way that others view him and treat him.  The plot developments themselves are conveyed efficiently and succinctly', 'so that the emphasis is on the feelings and perceptions of the characters.  The acting', 'camera work', 'and settings are all used very carefully to emphasize the changes that take place inside Jannings' character and in the attitudes of others towards him as a result of his demotion.These changes are often very (deliberately) exaggerated', 'and there are times when they honestly strain credibility a bit too much.  And it is not always easy to watch the doorman's anguish', 'but it gives you plenty to think about - part of his suffering comes from the foolish attitudes of others', 'but much of it also comes from his own over-dependence on his position for his happiness.  It is remarkable how much is expressed without even using title cards - there is just one in the entire movie', 'a note that introduces the last part of the film', 'when further developments occur that introduce a new set of themes.\"The Last Laugh\" is worth seeing for anyone who likes silent films', 'for its thought-provoking story and perhaps even more so for its creative and masterful use of silent film techniques.']

the, prologue, states, one, can, be, a, prince, one, day, but, what, is, he, tomorrow, this, tale, is, told, through, the, story, of, a, hotel, porter, that, has, worked, hard, all, his, life, but,

story, without, dialogue, is, preposterous, but, murnau, shows, his, prowess, by, doing, just, that, and, doing, it, down, to, a, fine, art, people, often, cite, citizen, kane, for, being, the, film, that, took, storytelling, to, the, next, level, and, although, it, did, do, that, surely, some, of, the, credit, has, to, go, to, f, w, murnau, this, film, features, what, is, perhaps, the, first,

the, film, the, film, falls, down, a, bit, towards, the, end, because, of, an, ill, advised, twist, this, was, put, upon, f, w, murnau, by, the, studio, releasing, the, film, who, wanted, a, happy, ending, this, is, just, another, example, of, a, studio, spoiling, a, great, movie, and, even, before, i, saw, that, piece, of, information, in, the, trivia, section, for, this, movie, it, was, evident, to, me, that, it, isn, t, the, way, that, murnau, wanted, to, take, the, story, from, the, way, it, almost, appeared, to, be, tacked, on, to, the, end, of, the, film, still, the, hour, and, ten, minutes, running, up, the, ending, are, almost, as, good, as, silent, cinema, gets, and, in, spite, of, the, studio, s, best, efforts, to, ruin, it, the, last, laugh, stands, tall, as, on, of,

but, this, is, a, film, so, simple, in, its, themes, so, modest, in, its, methods, that, it, doesn, t, lend, itself, to, these, labels, very, easily, nosferatu, was, revolutionary, but, based, on, intensity, something, that, doesn, t, age, very, well, other, directors, took, up, this, notion, of, visual, intensity, leni, boese, but, structuralized, it, and, created, the, real, german, horror, masterpieces, waxworks, golem, murnau, s, discovery, came, later, with, this, film, that, film, narrative, wasn, t, something, that, you, followed, linearly, but, something, you, become, immersed, in, the, lack, of, title, cards, is, not, a, gimmick, but, a, conscious, decision, not, to, interrupt, the, flow, of, this, immersion, reading, is, rational, hearing, slightly, less, so, and, prevents, this, from, taking, place, add, a, gogolian, tale, of, aging, and, dignity, and, murnau, makes, magic, this, is, what, touching, and, moving, films, should, be, like, 4, out, of, 5, an, excellent, film, the, camera, work, and, the, sets, in, this, film, where, so, breathtaking, and, powerful, that, they, changed, the, film, language, forever, it, is, in, many, ways, the, citizen, kane, of, its, time, it, was, so, revolutionary, that, hollywood, fox, tried, desperately, to, get, murnau, to, work, for, them, and, teach, them, how, to, do, all, these, things, which, he, did, some, years, later, the, main, revolutionary, thing, was, the, fluidity, of, the, camera, or, the, unchanged, camera, as, it, was, called, there, was, no, steady, cam, at, this, time, but, still, they, managed, to, strap, the, camera, to, the, body, of, the, cameraman, without, getting, a, shaky, pictures, the, set, is, just, amazing, it, is, difficult, to, believe, that, this, is, not, a, real, city, all, the,

old, when, he, made, this, film, but, he, really, looks, like, an, old, man, and, acts, like, one, too, but, the, greatest, thing, about, this, film, is, how, much, murnau, manages, to, say, with, out, the, help, of, inter, titles, this, is, visual, storytelling, at, it, s, best, murnau, had, come, a, long, way, from, nosferatu, but, he, still, had, a, long, way, to, go, and, a, lot, to, teach, us, before, his, untimely, death, the, last, laugh, is, not, only, one, of, his, best, films, it, is, also, most, likely, his, most, important, one, and, one, of, the, most, important, films, in,

effect, of, this, change, on, the, doorman, and, on, the, way, that, others, view, him, and, treat, him, the, plot, developments, themselves, are, conveyed, efficiently, and, succinctly, so, that, the, emphasis, is, on, the, feelings, and, perceptions, of, the, characters, the, acting, camera, work, and, settings, are, all, used, very, carefully, to, emphasize, the, changes, that, take, place, inside, jannings, character, and, in, the, attitudes, of, others, towards, him, as, a, result, of, his, demotion, these, changes, are, often, very, deliberately, exaggerated, and, there, are, times, when, they, honestly, strain, credibility, a, bit, too, much, and, it, is, not, always, easy, to, watch, the, doorman, s, anguish, but, it, gives, you, plenty, to, think, about, part, of, his, suffering, comes, from, the, foolish, attitudes, of, others, but, much, of, it, also, comes, from, his, own, over, dependence, on, his, position, for, his, happiness, it, is, remarkable, how, much, is, expressed, without, even, using, title, cards, there, is, just, one, in, the, entire, movie, a, note, that, introduces, the, last, part, of, the, film, when, further, developments, occur, that, introduce, a, new, set, of, themes, the, last, laugh, is, worth, seeing, for, anyone, who, likes, silent, films, for, its, thought, provoking, story, and, perhaps, even, more, so, for, its, creative,
